TCP is a *connection oriented service* since it is based on connections between client and server.

Unlike [[UDP|UDP]], TCP provides reliability, because a request need acknowledgment to return.

If an acknowledgment is not received, TCP automatically re-transmit the data and wait for a longer time.
