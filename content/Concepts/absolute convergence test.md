# Absolute Convergence Test
If the series $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$ is [[./absolute convergence of series|absolute convergent]], then it is also conditionally convergent.

Furthermore, in this case we have [[triangle inequality|triangle inequality]]:
$$
\left| \sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n \right| \le \sum_{n=m}^\infty |a_n|
$$
