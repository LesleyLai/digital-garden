The **68–95–99.7 rule** or **empirical rule** is a shorthand for remembering the percentage of values that lie within an [[interval estimate|interval estimate]] in a [[./normal distribution|normal distribution]].


![[../assets/normal_dist_68_rule.jpg|600]]

- **68%** of values fall within **1** [[standard deviation|standard deviation]] of the [[mean|mean]]
- **95%** of values fall within **2** standard deviations of the mean
- **99.7%** of values fall within **3** standard deviations of the mean

We can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to do some rough estimation of the [[./cumulative distribution function|CDF]] of a normal distribution function. For example,
$$
\begin{align}
P(N(5, 9) < 8) = 50\% + 68\%/2 = 84\%
\end{align}
$$
(we are calculate the area under the curve till mean + 1 stdv)
