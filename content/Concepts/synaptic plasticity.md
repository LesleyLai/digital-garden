# Synaptic Plasticity
**Synaptic plasticity** refers to the brain's ability to adjust and accommodate new information. This process occurs at [[./synapse|synapses]], the connections between neurons that facilitate communication.

There are two kinds of synaptic plasticity. [[short-term synaptic plasticity|Short-term synaptic plasticity]] refers to change of synaptic strength in sub second scale, where [[long-term synaptic plasticity|long-term synaptic plasticity]] is how we create and store memory.
