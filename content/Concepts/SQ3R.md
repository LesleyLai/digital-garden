**SQ3R** is a read-comprehension method that involves 5 steps:
1. Survey (skim)
2. Question (generate questions about the context of the reading)
  - e.g. "What is the chapter about?"
  - "What question is this chapter trying to answer?"
  - "How does the content of this chapter help me?"
3. Read
4. Recite
  - Put the source aside and try to recite in my own words
5. Review
  - review source and see if the recitation is satisfying (if so I can take note, otherwise repeat)

The SQ3R method is developed by Francis P. Robinson, an American education philosopher in his 1946 book _Effective Study_.
