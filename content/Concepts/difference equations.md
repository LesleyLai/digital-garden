The **difference equation** is the discrete analog to [[./differential equations|differential equations]]. They are great ways to model [[./discrete signals and systems|discrete systems]].

What makes this first order is that we only need to know the most recent previous value to find the next value. It also has clear parallel to the [[first-order ordinary differential equation|first-order ODEs]].
