# Instruction Set Architectures

An **Instruction set architecture** (ISA) can be seen as an abstraction of CPU from a programmer's perspective. It defines how the hardware should interpret the machine language.

## RISC Vs CISC
RISC: _reduced_ instruction set computers (ARM)
- Keep instruction set small and highly optimized
- Simpler and smaller chips. Lower manufacturing costs and power usage
- Some complex operations need to be implemented as subroutines
CISC: _complex_ instruction set computers (x86)
- Adds many specialized instructions
