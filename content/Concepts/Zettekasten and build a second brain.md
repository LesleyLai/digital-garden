# Zettelkasten and Build a Second Brain
While both Zettelkasten and Build a Second Brain (BASE) are note-taking methodologies, they serve distinct purposes and can be combined. BASE can be considered a time management technique builds on the tradition of Getting Things Done. Its focus is about reduce mental overload. 

Where BASE ends, Zettelkasten begins. The [[./progressive summarization|progressive summarization]] technique of BASE never leave the source material. By contrast, Zettelkasten [[./concept notes|concept notes]] are always distinct from source materials.

Another distinction is that Zettelkasten requires a significant initial effort to create concept notes but entails no ongoing maintenance. It's fine to leave your Zettelkasten untouched for months and return to it later. In contrast, [[./PARA framework|PARA]] demands lower initial effort and entails (relatively low) regular maintenance. However, [[./design a system for the laziest version of yourself|both methods continue to function effectively even when we are at a low point]] due to their low maintenance requirements.
