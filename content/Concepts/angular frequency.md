**Angular frequency**, or **angular speed**, corresponds to the rotation speed in a [[circular motion|circular motion]]. It is measured as the [[./derivative|rate of change]] of angles in units of radians per second.

Since [[./sinusoid|sinusoidal wave]] can be interpreted as projection of circular motion, angular frequency is also often used in the context of waves, oscillations, and [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analysis]].

The relationship between the angular frequency $\omega$ and the ordinary [[frequency and period of waves|frequency]] $f$ is
$$
\omega = 2 \pi f
$$
Sometimes angular frequency is loosely referred to as "frequency," though this use can lead to confusing.
