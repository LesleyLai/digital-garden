An **electric current** is a flow of charged particles.

It is defined as the amount of charge passing through a specific point or boundary per unit of time. This can be represented mathematically as s $i = \frac{dq}{dt}$ where $q$ denotes [[electric charge|charge]].

The SI unit of current is Ampere ($A$). The unit of [[electric charge|charge]], coulomb, is derived from Ampere, with the following relationship:
$$
1\ \text{ampere} = 1\ \text{coulomb/second}
$$
