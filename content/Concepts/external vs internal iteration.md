**External iterator** give you an iterator to step over [^stackoverflow]:

```java
for (Iterator iter = list.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {
  Object obj = iter.next();
  // Operate on obj
}
```

Instead, **internal iterator** require you to pass a callback to run over a collection  [^stackoverflow]:

```scala
list.foreach(elem => /* do something */)
```

External iterator is the primary paradigm in [[./C++ iterators|C++]] and [[./Rust iterator|Rust]].
## Pros and Cons
External iterator gives user more flexibility and explicit control on how to use the iterator. [^3] On the other hand, they are often not linking-friendly and requires to inline tons-of library code to be efficient. [^1] [^2]

Internal iterator are often easier to implement. For languages that support  [[generator|generators]], we can implement external iterator using a convenient syntax as if we are implementing internal iterator.

  - It is hard to have a bulk operation sharing an external iterator API and that is why the author want to distinguish "iterator" and "traversable"
- [[./pull parser vs push parser|pull parser vs push parser]] - can be seen an instance of this problem
- [[generator|generators]] - can be used to implement external iterators with a convenient syntax
