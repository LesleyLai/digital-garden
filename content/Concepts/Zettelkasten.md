The **"slip-box" (or Zettelkasten)** method is a workflow of taking notes and improving writing. It splits notes into three categories, [[./fleeting notes|fleeting notes]], [[./literature notes|literature notes]], and [[./concept notes|concept notes]]. Literature notes and concept notes are called *permanent notes* in combination.

There are three principles of Zettelkasten: hyperlinked, [[./principle of atomicity|atomicity]], and personal.
