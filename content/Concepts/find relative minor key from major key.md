To determine the relative minor of a major key, you can move three steps to the right in the [[./circle of fifths|circle of fifths]] to locate its relative major. For instance, beginning with C major, we progress to C -> G -> D -> A, indicating that its relative minor is A minor. Likewise, to find the relative major from a minor key, you can move three steps to the left.
