title: partial_sum, exclusive_scan, and inclusive_scan
---
All three implements the [[./prefix sum|scan]] algorithm. The difference between `partial_sum` and `inclusive_scan` is that `partial_sum` guarantee evaluation order, so it can get deterministic result even with non-associative binary operator. On the other hand, `partial_sum` is not parallelable because of this property.
