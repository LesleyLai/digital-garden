[[Nick Milo|Nick Milo]] offers criticism of progressive summarization, suggesting it can result in [[./the collector's fallacy|over-collecting]], over-summarization and under thinking.

He also critiqued the term "progressive summarization," arguing that it diverges significantly from traditional summarization and could confuse people. Instead, he proposed calling the technique "just-in-time summarization."

Another point he made is that [[./highlighting is ineffective|highlighting is known to be ineffective by research]] and it can makes [[./illusion of progress|illusion of learning]], where people can [[./mere exposure effect|confuse familiarity with understanding]].

Instead, Milo suggests a process he calls "active idealization." In this approach, you make highlights while also writing comments in real-time. Subsequently, you generate notes based on these highlights and comments. 

Lesley: His suggested approach is quite similar to my combined [[./PARA framework|PARA]] and [[./Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] methods.

Also Lesley: there is a debate between Milo and proponents of progressive summarization and I don't have a strong opinion on either side.
