# Chromaticity

**Chromaticity** is the intensity-independent components of color. And **chromaticity diagram** can be used to visualize the extend of a [[./color space and color model|color space]].

A chromaticity diagram usually use the reference [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 color space]] (related to [[XYZ|XYZ color model]]) which captures all colors an average human can see. And it will then overlay other color spaces on top of it for comparison:
