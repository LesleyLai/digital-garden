In [[./context-free grammar|context-free grammar]], a [[nonterminal symbol|nonterminal]] is **left recursive** if the left-most symbol of one of its productions is itself.

[[recursive descent parsers|recursive descent parsers]] cannot handle grammar with left recursion but we can transform the grammar to eliminate left recursion. However, this will either introduce right associativity or complicate the grammar. [^1]
