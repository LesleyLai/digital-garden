# Experimental Programming Languages

Here are several relatively new programming languages that, while I wouldn't use them in production, may offer valuable insight and learning opportunities.
## System Programming Languages
- [[./The Hylo Programming Language|Hylo]]
- [[The Carbon Programming Language|Carbon]]
- [[Vale Programming Language|Vale Programming Language]]
- [Austral](https://github.com/austral/austral) ([[Austral|Notes]])
- [Scopes](https://sr.ht/~duangle/scopes/) ([[Scopes Programing Language|Notes]])
- [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) ([[./Odin (programming langauge)|Notes]])
- [Mojo ðŸ”¥: Programming language for all of AI](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo)

## Parallel Languages
