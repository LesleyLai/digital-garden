# Capture
The principle of capture involves
- Capture in a centralized place
- Capture like a curator (be selective)
- Capture what resonate (no need for overanalyze for capturing)

## January 2024 Practice
As of January 2024, my current method of capturing information lacks centralization. I follow a diverse workflow that involves
- Scheduling todo list in [Emacs org mode](https://orgmode.org/)
- Saving interesting videos to Youtube's "watch later" list
- Writing concept notes and literature review in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (used to also using Emacs org mode but I find Obsidian requires much less tinkering)
- Saving research papers in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
- Saving web links in [Readwise](https://read.readwise.io/)
- Occasionally bookmarking social media posts
  
I adopt the above approach mainly because it requires minimum amount of trouble to capture resources in different category, but the overcomplicated system also makes it hard for me to organize resources and find information. Also, the inbox of almost all categories keep growing.
