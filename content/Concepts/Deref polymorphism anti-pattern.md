Using the [[Rust deref|`Deref`]] trait to emulate inheritance in [[./Rust|Rust]] is an anti-pattern.

It has subtle semantic difference from inheritance in OOP languages. In particular, `self` is not bind to the "subclass", but rather than class where the method is actually defined (think about non-`virtual` methods and [[./C++ Method Hiding|method hiding]] in C++)
