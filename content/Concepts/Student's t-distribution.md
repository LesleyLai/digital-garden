**Student's t-distribution**, or simply **t-distribution**, is a family of distributions with a similar bell shape to the [[./normal distribution|normal distribution]], but also take an additional parameter called the [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]].

It is used as a basis for the [[Student's t-test|t-test]] in statistics, which is useful for small sample sizes or when the population standard deviation is unknown.

The distribution was introduced by [[William Sealy Gosset|William Sealy Gosset]] in 1908 under the pseudonym "Student," hence the name.

## Shapes

The t-distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution, and as a result are more prone to producing values that fall far from the mean.

As the degrees of freedom increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.
