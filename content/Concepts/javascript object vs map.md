[[Javascript object|Javascript object]] itself is a map/dictionary so there are no use for extra type. That being said, the standard `Map` type provides support of non-string keys and there are people who propose we should use `Map` for majority of cases because of performance and ergonomics.

In [[./TypeScript|TypeScript]], a [[TypeScript mapped type|mapped type]] is the primary way to have a dictionary and a `Record<K, T>` is a short hand for `{ [P in K]: T; }`. Both correspond to Javascript objects in runtime. We can also use `Map` if we need its functionality.
