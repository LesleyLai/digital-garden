# Pratt Parsing

**Pratt parsing** (top down operator precedence parsing) uses the idea of "binding power" to handle operator precedence levels and associativity.

Comparing to encoding operator precedence in [[formal grammar|grammar]] and uses [[recursive descent parsers|recursive descent]], Pratt parser uses significant less recursion. Another important difference is that recursive descent parser associate semantic actions with grammar, while Pratt parsing associate actions with tokens. [^2]

[[Matklad|Matklad]] stated that Pratt Parsing and the [[shunting yard algorithm|shunting yard algorithm]] are essentially the same algorithm [^1] The main difference is that Pratt Parsing uses recursion while Shunting Yard keeps an explicit stack.
