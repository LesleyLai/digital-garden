A formula is in its **normal form** when it has been simplified to a canonical representation according to a specific set of rules, and no further rewrite can be applied using those rules.

## Examples
### Propositional Logic
- [[./conjunctive normal form|conjunctive normal form]]

### Predicate Logic
- [[./Prenex normal form|Prenex normal form]]
