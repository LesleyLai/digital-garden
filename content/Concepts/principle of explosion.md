**principle of explosion** or **ex falso quodlibet** is the observation that any [[./argument|argument]] in which the premises form an unsatisfiable set is [[./valid argument|valid]]. A specific example is when there is a signal premise and it is an [[./contradiction|contradiction]].

> [!info] **Ex falso quodlibet** means "from falsehood, anything \[follows\]" in Latin.

The phrase "[and I'm the queen of England](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndImTheQueenOfSheba)!" is often used as sarcastic comment can be seen as an informal, colloquial example of ex falso quodlibet.

## Symbolic Representation
We can express the principle of explosion symbolically as the following:
$$
P, \lnot P \ \vdash \ Q
$$
Which reads as: for any statements $P$ and $Q$, if $P$ and not $P$ are both true, then it [[./entailment and provability|logically followed]] that $Q$ is true.
