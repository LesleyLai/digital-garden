The **geometric series** is $\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n$. 

The [[./convergence of series|convergence]] of geometric series depends on the value of $x$.

- If $|x| \ge 1$, the geometric series diverges
- If $|x| < 1$, the series converges to $\frac{1}{1-x}$

We can solve the infamous [[./0.999... = 1|0.999... = 1]] question by treating $0.999\dots$ as a geometric series.
