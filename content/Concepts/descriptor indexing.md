# Vulkan Descriptor Indexing
See also [[./descriptor sets|descriptor sets]]

With descriptor indexing, we can have
- Much larger descriptor sets
- Flexible descriptor updates
- Non-uniform indexing (with `NonUniformResourceIndex`)

## Flexible Descriptor Updates
With descriptor indexing, it's OK to have invalid descriptors in a binding if they're not in use. Though we need a flag `VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_PARTIALLY_BOUND_BIT` when creating binding.
