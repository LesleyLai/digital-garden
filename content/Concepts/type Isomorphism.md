Two types are said to be **isomorphic** (denoted by $\tau_{1} \cong \tau_{2}$) when they contain the same information. More formally, $\tau_{1} \cong \tau_{2}$ **iff** there exists [[./bijection|bijective functions]] $f: \tau_{1} \rightarrow \tau_{2}$ and $g: \tau_{2} \rightarrow \tau_{1}$ between them and invert each other.
