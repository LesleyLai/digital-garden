# Manifold
Intuitively, surfaces are manifold if you can draw a regular coordinate grid when zooming in far enough. For example, earth looks flat when near the ground.

Not all shapes are manifold.

## Polygon Meshes
A manifold [[polygon mesh|polygon mesh]] has fans, but not fins.

There are two conditions to check:
1. Every edge is contained in only two polygons (no "fins")
2. The polygons containing each vertex make a single "fan"
