**Spherical coordinates** uses two angles $\theta, \phi$ to specify the direction of a 3d vector and its length to locate a point in space.

The relationship between the spherical coordinates and the 3D [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian coordinates]] is the following:
$$
\begin{aligned}
 x&=r \sin \theta \cos \phi \\
 y&=r \sin \theta \sin \phi \\
 z&=r \cos \theta
\end{aligned}
$$
