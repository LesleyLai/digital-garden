# Closure Property of Vectors

A collection of vectors in a [[./vector space|vector space]] must be _closed under_ [[./linear combination|linear combination]] (addition and scalar multiplication): $a \mathbf{v} \in V$ and $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in V$.

> [!example]- A set of 2d vectors only contain positive components
> is **not a vector space** since linear combination of its element can results in vectors with negative components. E.g. $-[1, 1]^T = [-1, -1]^T$
