# Directional Derivative

**Directional derivative** of a multi-variable function is the single-variable derivative on that direction.
$$
D_{\mathbf{u}}f(\mathbf{x}_{0}) = lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(\mathbf{x}_{0} + \epsilon \mathbf{u}) - f(\mathbf{x}_{0})}{\epsilon}
$$

It can be seen as a generalization of [[./partial derivative|partial derivative]].

[[./Multi-dimensional derivative, gradient, and directional Derivative|The directional derivative is highly related to multi-dimensional derivative, and it can also be defined as a dot product of the gradient and direction]]: $D_{\mathbf{u}}(f) = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u} = [Df]\mathbf{u}$
