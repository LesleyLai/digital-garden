# Progressive Summarization

When writing notes, there is a contention between *compression* and *context*. We want to compress note to make key insight more discoverable, yet this inevitably involves sacrificing context, potentially making the notes less understandable in the future.

**Progressive summarization** is a technique that gradually refine a note to make it more compressed. It contains the following layer:
- layer 0: source material
- layer 1: source material that brought to a [[./literature notes|literature note]]
- layer 2: bold parts of layer 1
- layer 3: highlight parts of layer 2
- layer 4: small summary
- layer 5: remix

Not all notes need all layers, and we also only summarize notes when we are already reviewing it. This is important since we don't want to spend time and energy on unimportant notes. In other words, [[design a system for the laziest version of yourself|design a system for the laziest version of yourself]].
