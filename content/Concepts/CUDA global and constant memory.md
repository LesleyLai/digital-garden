- Long latency
- Off-chip, read/write access
- Random access causes performance hit (sequential access is better)
- Host can read/write
  - Reads are cached
  - Writes invalidate the cache

Host can access global and constant variables with
- `cudaGetSymbolAddress()
- `cudaGetSymbolSize()`
- `cudaMemcpyToSymbol()`
- `cudaMemcpyFromSymbol()`

Constants must be declared outside of a function body.
