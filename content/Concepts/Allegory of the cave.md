# Allegory of the Cave
[[Plato|Plato]] tells the allegory of the Cave in his work _[[Republic (plato)|Republic]]_.

[[Socrates|Socrates]] says that if a prisoner escapes the cave and came back to share the news of the outside world, other prisoners are unlikely to believe them. Worse, the prisoner's eye would be adapted to the Sun and thus can't see in the dark, so other people would infer that the journey to outside the cave is harmful.
