# Orthogonal Matrix
An **orthogonal matrix**, or **orthonormal matrix**, is a square matrix whose columns and rows are [[./orthonormality|orthonormal]] vectors.

Some examples of orthogonal matrices are [[./rotation|rotation matrices]] and [[permutation matrix|permutation matrices]].

## Properties of Orthogonal Matrices
- [[./Inverse of a orthogonal matrix is its transpose|Inverse of a orthogonal matrix is its transpose]]
- [[./Orthogonal Matrices Preserve Norm|Orthogonal Matrices Preserve Norm]]
- [[./product of two orthogonal matrices is orthogonal|product of two orthogonal matrices is orthogonal]]
