An **orthogonal matrix**, or **orthonormal matrix**, is a square matrix whose columns and rows are [[./orthonormality|orthonormal]] vectors.

Some examples of orthogonal matrices are [[./rotation|rotation matrices]] and [[permutation matrix|permutation matrices]].

Orthogonal matrices imply [[./orthogonal transformation|orthogonal transformation]]. However, the converse is not true, as orthogonal transformations between [[./vector space|spaces]] may be neither finite-dimensional nor of the same dimension, and these have no orthogonal matrix equivalent. [^1]

- [[./Orthogonal Matrices Preserve Norm|Orthogonal Matrices Preserve Norm]]
- [[./product of two orthogonal matrices is orthogonal|product of two orthogonal matrices is orthogonal]]
