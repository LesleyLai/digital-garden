In [[./Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] methods, **fleeting notes** are temporary notes to quickly capture ideas while working. They may not make sense without context. Thus, those notes need to be processed in a day or two.

I use a combination of good old note book and daily notes to handle fleeting notes.
