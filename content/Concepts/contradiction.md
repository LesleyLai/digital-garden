A [[./proposition|proposition]] $p$ is a **contradiction** if it is false for all possible [[interpretations (logic)|truth value assignments]] to its variables. In other word, it is not [[satisfiability|satisfiable]].

Two propositions are **contradictory** if they have opposite truth value in every row of the [[./truth table|truth table]].

Keep in mind that the concept of contradiction differs from that of [[./contraries|contraries]]. Contraries only require that both propositions cannot be true simultaneously, but they can both be false at the same time.
