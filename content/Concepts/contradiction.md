A [[./proposition|proposition]] $\varphi$ is a **contradiction** if $\varphi \vdash \bot$ (when we can prove that $\varphi$ is always false).

For [[./completeness|complete]] logic, contradiction is equivalent to [[./satisfiability|unsatisfiable]].

Keep in mind that the concept of contradiction differs from that of [[./contraries|contraries]]. Contraries only require that both propositions cannot be true simultaneously, but they can both be false at the same time.
