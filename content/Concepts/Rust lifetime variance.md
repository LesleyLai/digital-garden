# Lifetime Variance in Rust

In Rust, you can pass a `&'static str` to a function that accepts a `& 'a str`. 

The result is that we treat `'b` as a [[subtyping|subtype]] of `'a` if `'b` outlives `'a`. And in Rust,  [[generic lifetime in Rust|generic lifetime]] in function parameters are contravariant, and generic lifetime in function return types are covariant.
