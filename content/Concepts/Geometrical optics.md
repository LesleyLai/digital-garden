**Geometric optics**, also known as **ray optics**, is a simplified model of light propagation that represents light as [[ray|rays]]. Though not fully accurate, this model is commonly used in applications such as [[./ray tracing|ray tracing]]. However, it has limitations, and it cannot model certain [[optical phenomena|optical phenomena]], even for certain visible effects such as [[diffraction|diffraction]], [[interference|interference]], [[fluorescence|fluorescence]], [[phosphorescence|phosphorescence]].
