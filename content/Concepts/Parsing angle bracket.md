We need to solve certain ambiguities to parse angle brackets for generic parameters.

One ambiguity raise where when we meet `>>`, whether to parse it as shift operator or two angle brackets.

Another ambiguity raises when we have constructs that can be interpreted as templated types or comparison expressions. For example, is `A (B < C, D > (E))` a function call on `A` with two boolean arguments `B < C` and `D > (E)`, or is it a function call on `A` with a single argument of type `B<C, D>`? [WGSLl](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@dneto/109801892099938143) says the 2nd.
