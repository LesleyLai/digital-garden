The **clustering illusion** is the tendency to erroneously consider the inevitable clusters arising in small samples from random distributions to be non-random.

The cluster illusion is so strong that game AI developers find that introducing biases (with [[filtered randomness|filtered randomness]]) into video games' [[./Pseudorandom number generator|RNG]] process will make it appear more "random" to humans. [^1]
