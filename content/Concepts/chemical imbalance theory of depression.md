# Chemical Imbalance Theory of Depression

**"Chemical imbalance"** is a long discarded hypothesis [^1] that low [[./serotonin|serotonin]]-level causes depression. Modern researches found that depression is not generally linked with serotonin deficiency [^review].

This idea was heavily pushed by drug companies to sell [[serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor|serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) compounds [^1].

This explanation also has the stigmatizing effect by insinuation that something in the brain *isn't working as it’s supposed to* or as *nature intended*. Further, it encourage a [[./growth mindset|fixed mindset]] on emotion, which prevent people from seeking therapy.  [^harm]
