The idea that "men and women are from different planet" are popularized by a "popular psychology" book "_Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus_" which states that a lot of relationship problem are caused by fundamental psychological differences between genders. Despite there are some [[sex differences|sex differences]], there are no taxonomic difference between men and women in vast majority of personality traits and preferences.[^1]

The book "[[The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work|The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work]]" mentioned that it is a common marriage myth to think the two genders have such a fundamentally difference.
