# Crash Course Philosophy
## 1. What is Philosophy?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY

Ancient Greece
Philosophy
"The academic study of everything"

Studies that had strong empirical elements came to be considered as science - a search for answers.
But *Philosophy* came to be understood more as a way of *thinking about questions*.
Philosophers ask _big questions_. Questions that they can't have an answer.

Three major branches of philosophy
1. Metaphysics
> The branch of philosophy that studies the nature of reality

2. Epistemology (knowing about knowing)
> The branch of philosophy that studies the nature and scope of knowledge

3. Value Theory
> ethics: studies and evaluates human conducts
> aesthetics: study the nature of beauty
>   consider what beauty is and whether it exists or not

Also: Logic

Always try to understand the strongest, most persuasive version of an argument

*critical evaluation*
