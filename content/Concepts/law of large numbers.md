The **law of large numbers** (LLN) states that the [[mean|average]] of the outcomes from a large number of independent random samples converges to the [[./expectation|expected value]]. For example, if we flip a fair dice 100,000 times, the result should be closer to 0.5 than if we flip the dice 10 times on average.

More formally, the LLN states that given a sample of [[./independent and identically distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed values]], the [[sample mean and variance|sample mean]] converges to the population mean. [^1]

Note that the LLN only applies to the [[sample mean and variance|sample mean]]. It does not claim that the sample sum gets close to the $n E(X)$ when $n$ increase.
