**Convolution** is a mathematical operation of combining two functions $f$ and $g$ and forming a third function $f * g$. It can be view as the amount of overlap of one function when it is shifted over another function.

## Visual Explanation
Discrete convolution is often visualized as flipping one of the input signals (we call it the kernel or filter) and using it as [[weighted average|weights]] to compute a [[moving average|moving average]] over another signal.

  Similarly, continuous convolution can be visualized by the "sliding windows" process.

## Properties of Convolution
Convolution has several nice properties:
- $f * g = g * f$ ([[commutativity|commutativity]])
- $f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h$ ([[associativity|associativity]])
- $f * (g + h) = (f * g) + (f * h)$ ([[distributivity|distributivity]])
- $f(t) * \delta(t - T) = f(t - T)$ ([[./impulse convolution|impulse convolution]])
- If $y(t) = f(t) * g(t)$, then $f(t - T) * g(t) = f(t) * g(t - T) = y(t - T)$ (time shift property)
- If $f(t) * g(t) = y(t)$, $f(at) * g(at) = \left|\frac{1}{a}\right|\ y(at)$ ([[./time scaling property of convolution|time scaling property]])
 
## Convolution Theorem
> See: [[./convolution theorem|convolution theorem]]

When transforming time-domain signals to [[./time and frequency domain|frequency domain]], convolution operation becomes multiplication and vice-versa
- $\mathcal{L}\{ f * g \} = \mathcal{L}\{ f \} \mathcal{L}\{ g \}$ and $\mathcal{F}\{ f * g \} = \mathcal{F}\{ f \} \mathcal{L}\{ g \}$

## Applications
Convolutions has various applications. For example:
- [[./polynomial multiplication as convolution|multiplication of polynomials as convolution]]
- [[convolution of probability distributions|sum of probability distributions as convolution]]
- convolution can be used to express the output of a [[./linear time-invariant system|linear time-invariant system]] when [[./zero-input response and zero-state response|zero-state response]] and input is given
- Convolution is often used to define [[weighted average|weighted-average]] filters such as the [[Gaussian filtering|Gaussian filtering]]
- Convolution with a [[rectangular function|rectangular pulse]] generate [[moving average|moving average]]Â (smoothing) of the original signal
