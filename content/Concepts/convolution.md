**Convolution** is a mathematical operation of combining two functions $f$ and $g$ and forming a third function $f * g$. It can be view as the amount of overlap of one function when it is shifted over another function,

## Properties of Convolution
Convolution has several nice properties:
- $f * g = g * f$ ([[commutativity|commutativity]])
- $f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h$ ([[associativity|associativity]])
- $f * (g + h) = (f * g) + (f * h)$ ([[distributivity|distributivity]])
- $f(t) * \delta(t - T) = f(t - T)$ ([[./impulse convolution|impulse convolution]])
- $\mathcal{L}\{ f * g \} = \mathcal{L}\{ f \} \mathcal{L}\{ g \}$ and $\mathcal{F}\{ f * g \} = \mathcal{F}\{ f \} \mathcal{L}\{ g \}$ ([[./convolution theorem|convolution theorem]])

## Applications
Convolutions has 
- [[./polynomial multiplication as convolution|multiplication of polynomials as convolution]]
- [[convolution of probability distributions|sum of probability distributions as convolution]]
- convolution can be used to express the output of a [[./linear time-invariant system|linear time-invariant system]] when [[./zero-input response and zero-state response|zero-state response]] and input is given
