**Convolution** is a mathematical operation of combining two functions $f$ and $g$ and forming a third function $f * g$. It can be view as the amount of overlap of one function when it is shifted over another function.

## Properties of Convolution
Convolution has several nice properties:
- $f * g = g * f$ ([[commutativity|commutativity]])
- $f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h$ ([[associativity|associativity]])
- $f * (g + h) = (f * g) + (f * h)$ ([[distributivity|distributivity]])
- $f(t) * \delta(t - T) = f(t - T)$ ([[./impulse convolution|impulse convolution]])
- If $y(t) = f(t) * g(t)$, then $f(t - T) * g(t) = f(t) * g(t - T) = y(t - T)$ (time shift property)
- If $f(t) * g(t) = y(t)$, $f(at) * g(at) = \left|\frac{1}{a}\right|\ y(at)$ ([[./time scaling property of convolution|time scaling property]])
 
## Applications
