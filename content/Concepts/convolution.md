# Convolution

**Convolution** is a mathematical operation of combining two functions $f$ and $g$ and forming a third function $f * g$. It can be view as the amount of overlap of one function when it is shifted over another function,

## Properties of Convolution
Convolution has several nice properties:
- $f * g = g * f$ ([[commutativity|commutativity]])
- $f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h$ ([[associativity|associativity]])
- $f * (g + h) = (f * g) + (f * h)$ ([[distributivity|distributivity]])

## Applications
- [[./polynomial multiplication as convolution|multiplication of polynomials as convolution]]
- [[convolution of probability distributions|sum of probability distributions as convolution]]
- convolution can be used to express the output of a [[linear time-invariant system|linear time-invariant system]] when zero state response and input is given as input
