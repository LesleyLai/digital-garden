A real function is called **convex** or **concave upward** when the slope increases. Similarly, a function is called **concave** or **concave downward** when the slope decreases.

One way to test whether a function is convex or concave is to take [[./second derivative test|the second derivative]]. If the second derivative over an interval is
- always positive, then the slope continually increases, and the function is *convex*
- always negative, then the slope continually decrease, and the function is *concave*
