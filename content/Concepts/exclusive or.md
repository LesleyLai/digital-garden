**Exclusive or**, or **exclusvie disjunction**, abbreviated as **XOR**, is a [[./logical connective|logical operator]] with the following truth table:

| $A$ | $B$ | $A \oplus B$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| F   | F   | F            |
| F   | T   | T            |
| T   | F   | T            |
| T   | T   | F            |

Symbols used to represent exclusive or including $\oplus$ (`\oplus`) and $\veebar$ (`\veebar`).

One way to understand the xor operator is "addition modulo 2".
