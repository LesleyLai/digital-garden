# Snell's Law
**Snell's Law**, or law of [[refraction|refraction]], describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction index in refraction.
$$
n_1 \sin_{\theta_1} = n_2 \sin_{\theta_2}
$$
Note that Snell's Law doesn't always have a solution. When it does not have a solution, [[./total internal reflection|total internal reflection]] happens.
