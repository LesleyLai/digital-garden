**Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy** is an informal logical fallacy where differences in data are ignored but similarities are overemphasized. It is related to human tendency to see patterns when none exists.

The fallacy is strongly related with [[./clustering illusion|clustering illusion]], the tendency to erroneously consider the inevitable "clusters" arising in small samples from random distributions to be non-random.
