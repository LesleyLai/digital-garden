Signals defined only at discrete instants of time $t_0, t_1, \dots, t_n$ are **discrete signals**, denoted by symbols $x(x_n)$, $x(y_n)$, and so on, where $n$ is an integer. Systems whose inputs and outputs are discrete signals are **discrete systems**.

If the samples are uniformly distributed, we further simplify this notation to $x[n], y[n], \dots$ 

Discrete signals naturally occur in scenarios where the input is inherently discrete. They can also result from [[./sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] continuous-time signals. For example, in [[filter (signal processing)|digital filtering]], a continuous signal $x(t)$ is first sampled to convert into a discrete signal $x[t]$, which then is processed by a discrete-time system to yield an output $y[t]$, and at the end we [[./sample reconstruction|reconstruct]] a continuous system $y(t)$.

## Discrete System Representation
Instead of differential equations, we can use [[./difference equations|difference equations]] to represent a discrete system. For example,
$$
y[n] = x[n] - x[n - 1]
$$
An alternative is a [[block diagram|block diagram]] like the following:

Difference equations are mathematically precise and concise. However, since difference equation is declarative, it does not show the signal flow path. On the other hand, the block diagram is imperative, and can directly translate into a hardware implementation or an algorithm. [^2]

Another alternative representation that combines the strength of difference equations and block diagrams are the [[signal operators|operator notation]]. For example, let $\mathcal{R}$ be the right-shift operation, and let $X$ and $Y$ represents the whole input and output signals, then we can represent the above system as
$$
Y = X - \mathcal{R}X = (1 - \mathcal{R})X
$$
