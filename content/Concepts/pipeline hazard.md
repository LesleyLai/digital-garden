# Pipeline Hazards
[[CPU pipelining|Pipelined architecture]] hides CPU latency. However, there are cases known as **pipeline hazards** where CPUs can't executing next instruction in the following clock cycle.

There are multiple kinds of pipeline hazards:
- _structural hazard_: multiple instructions competing the same part of the CPU
- _data hazard_: CPU is waiting an operand to be computed in the previous step
- _control hazard_: CPU can't tell which instruction to execute next

Pipeline hazards cause _pipeline stall_, where CPU need to wait idle.

## Control Hazard and the Cost of Branching
CPU performs _speculated execution_ when facing [[branching|branching]], so the performance of branching highly depends on how well the CPU can predict the branch. In a 50/50 coin toss, the CPU will meet _control hazard_ since it doesn't know what branch to execute next. We can use [[./branchless programming|branchless programming]] to avoid branching in hot paths.
