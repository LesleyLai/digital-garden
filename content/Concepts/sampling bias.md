**Sampling bias** is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others. It results in a biased sample of a population in which all individuals, or instances, were not equally likely to have been selected.

See the [friendship paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox), where it is observed that on average, an individual's friends have more friends than that individual, is an example of the friendship paradox.
