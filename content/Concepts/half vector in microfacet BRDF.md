The half-vector $\mathbf{h}$ in a microfacet BRDF precisely indicates the direction in which the microfacets need to point. This is due to our treatment of microfacets as ideal mirror surfaces; consequently, only those microfacets with their surface normals oriented exactly halfway between the light direction $l$ and the viewing direction $v$ will reflect visible light.
