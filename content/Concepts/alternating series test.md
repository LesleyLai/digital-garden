Let $\sum_{n=m}^\infty a_n$ be a series of non-negative and decreasing real numbers, thus $a_n \ge 0$ and $a_{n} > a_{n+1}$ for every $n$.

Then the series $\sum_{n=m}^\infty (-1)^n a_n$ convergent **iff** the sequence $a_n$ [[./convergence of sequences|converges]] to $0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
