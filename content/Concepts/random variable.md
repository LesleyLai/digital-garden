**Random variable** represents the distribution of potential outcomes. There are two kind of random variables: discrete and continuous.

## Discrete Random Variable
Discrete random variables contains [[./countability|countable]] set of [[./outcome|outcome]]. It can be represented by [[./probability mass function|probability mass function]].

## Continuous Random Variable

Continuous random variables describe _measurable_, infinite possible outcomes. It can be represented by [[./probability density function|probability density function]].

## Functions on Random Variables
- [[./probability density function|PDF]] and [[./probability mass function|PMF]]
- [[./cumulative distribution function|CDF]]
- [[quantile function
