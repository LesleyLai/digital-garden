**Random variable** represents the distribution of potential outcomes. There are two kind of random variables: discrete and continuous.

Discrete random variables contains [[./countability|countable]] set of [[./outcome|outcome]]. It can be represented by [[./probability mass function|probability mass function]].

## Continuous Random Variable

Continuous random variables describe _measurable_, infinite possible outcomes. It can be represented by [[./probability density function|probability density function]].
