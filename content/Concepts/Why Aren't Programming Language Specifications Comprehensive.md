CPython and PyPy behave differently with the following code:
```
$ cat diffs.py
print(str(0) is str(0))
$ python3 diffs.py
False
$ pypy diffs.py
True
```
## Deliberate Flexibility
- [[implementation-defined behavior|implementation-defined behavior]]

## Semi-inevitable Flexibility
e.g. timing

## Undesirable Flexibility
- [[./undefined behavior|undefined behavior]]

## Unknown Flexibility
- Not considered when designing the language
- such as [[memory model|memory model]] (how read/write memory in a concurrent environment)
