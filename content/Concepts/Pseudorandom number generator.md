# Pseudorandom Number Generator
Pseudorandom number generator generates a sequence of values depend on an initial _seed_.

It is a common technique used in simulation (such as [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo method]]), game dev (such as [[procedural generation|procedural generation]]), [[./randomized algorithms|randomized algorithms]], and [[cryptography|cryptography]].

There are a tradeoff between quality and speed, and no PRNG can fit the requirement of all application. That being said, there are some research on which PRNGs[^1] to pick.
