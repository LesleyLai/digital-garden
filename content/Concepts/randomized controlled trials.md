A **randomized controlled trial** (**RCT**) is a form of scientific experiment used to control factors not under direct experimental control. [^1] It is commonly used in medical research.

By randomly allocating participants among compared treatments, an RCT enables statistical control over influences of [[./confounding variable|confounding variables]].

## Blinding

With blinding experiment, information which may influence the participants of the experiment is withheld until after the experiment is complete. Blinding can reduce biases like the [[observer bias|observer bias]] and [[confirmation bias|confirmation bias]] in data collection. [^2]

The terms _single-blind_, _double-blind_ and _triple-blind_ are commonly used to describe different types of blinding. Most often, single-blind studies blind patients to their treatment allocation, double-blind studies blind both patients and researchers to treatment allocations, and triple-blinded studies blind patients, researcher, and some other third party (such as a monitoring committee) to treatment allocations. However, the meaning of these terms can vary. [^2]
