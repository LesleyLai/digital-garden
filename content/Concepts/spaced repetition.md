**Spaced repetition** is the learning practice of [[./retrieval practice|reviewing material]] at increasing intervals over time. It exploits the [[./spacing effect|spacing effect]] and has been proved to increase rate of learning. [^1] One technique to perform spaced repetition is with [[./flashcards|flashcards]].

[[Barbara Oakley|Barbara Oakley]] highlights one reason of spaced repetition's effectiveness: learning involves [[neuroplasticity|fostering new neural connections]], which requires time to develop. The intervals between study sessions provide time for neural growth. [^2]

Spaced repetition isn't limited to learning; we can also apply the same principle to [[./spaced repetition in habit forming|form habits]].
