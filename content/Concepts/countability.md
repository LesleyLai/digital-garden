# Countability

We can distinguish [[infinite set|infinite sets]] into **countable infinity** and **uncountable infinity**. An infinite set is **countably infinite** if it has the same [[cardinality|cardinality]] of [[natural numbers|natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$. Otherwise, a set is **uncountable**.

A set that is either finite or countably infinite is sometimes called **countable**. 
In other word, a set is countable if it has [[./injection|one-to-one]] correspondence with natural numbers.
