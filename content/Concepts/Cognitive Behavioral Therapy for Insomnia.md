**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)** is based on the idea that chronic insomnia is due to learned behavior that can be unlearned.

Components of CBT-I includes:
1. **sleep education**
2. **stimulus control** (behavioral)
   - primarily for difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia)
   - [[don't use bed for things other than sleeping|remove link between bed and being awake]]
   - remove items from bedroom that are incompatible with sleep
   - If you're unable to fall asleep for a while, leave the bed and only return when you feel drowsy
3. **sleep restriction** (behavioral)
  - More appropriately should be called "bed restriction"
  - aim to increase [[./adenosine|sleep drive]] and reduce time in bed laying awake
  - a.k.a. increasing [[sleep efficiency|sleep efficiency]]
4. **cognitive therapy**
  - Address and change unhealthy beliefs about sleep
