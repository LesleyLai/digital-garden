# Push Parser vs Pull Parser

When designing parsers as a reusable library (rather than a bespoke parser for a single purpose), we have the choice to make push parser and pull parser.

**Push Parsers**—Events are generated by the API in the form of callback functions like `startDocument()` and `endDocument()` and are beyond the programmer's control. We as programmers could handle the events, but the generation of events is beyond our control.

**Pull Parsers** - Events are generated when we call some API. Example shown below. So we, as programmers, can decide when to generate events. [^stackoverflow]

Push:
```java
if (myChar == '(')
    handler.handleOpenParen(); // push the open paren to the handler
```

Pull:
```java
Token token = parser.next(); // pull the next token from the parser
```

**Push vs pull** can be seen as a special instance of [[./external vs internal iteration|internal vs external iterator]].
## Pros and cons

Some advantages of a pull parser include loose coupling, less memory usage, and ease of use from the user side. [^pulldown-cmark]
