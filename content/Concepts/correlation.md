**Correlation** is a kind of statistical relation, [[./correlation does not imply causation|whether causal or not]], between two [[./random variable|random variables]] or bivariate data. [^1]

There are several types of correlation coefficient, which the most commonly used one being the [[./Pearson correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]] [^1], which measures linear correlation. Due to its ubiquity, some materials and sources treat the Pearson correlation coefficient as THE correlation coefficient.
