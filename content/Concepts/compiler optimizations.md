## Categories
- *Local optimization* works on a single [[./basic blocks|basic blocks]], and does not deal with [[./control flow graph|control flow]]
- *Global optimization* works with a single function, and deal with control flow
  - Dealing with control flow makes optimization much more complicated
- *Interprocedural optimization* that deals with multiple functions

Local/global optimizations are also called *intraprocedural optimization*
