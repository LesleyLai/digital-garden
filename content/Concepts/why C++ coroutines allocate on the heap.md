# Why C++ Coroutines Allocate on the Heap
A major complain of C++ coroutines is that it dynamically allocate by default and relies on compiler [[Halo|heap-elision]].

One reason for that design decision I can think of is that not having layout determined in frontend gives the optimizer opportunity to optimize out some variables.

However, [this insightful r/cpp comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/18b8zpy/comment/kc4s7lj/) highlights that storing coroutine states on the stack could limit them to header files (or module interface files) and can easily break ABI. Both are not a big problem for [[./async Rust|Rust]] since Rust's TUs are much larger (a crate) and have an unstable ABI by default.

Also see this table from [Coroutines: Use-cases and Trade-offs](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1493r0.pdf):
