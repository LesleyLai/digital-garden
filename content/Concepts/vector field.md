# Vector Field
A **vector field** assigns a vector to each point in space. [[./gradient|Gradient]] is an example of a vector field.

To understand the rate of change of a vector field, there are two basic quantities: [[./divergence|divergence]] and [[./curl|curl]]. *Divergence* describes how much a field shrink/expand and *curl* describes how much is the field spinning.
