# First-order Linear Homogeneous Differential Equation

The **first-order linear homogeneous differential equation** is a simple differential equation with the form
$$
\dot{y} = ay
$$
In words the equation says
> [!quote] the rate of change of y is proportional to y.

This differential equation is used to model [[exponential function|exponential growth (when a > 0) or decay (when a < 0)]], and its solution is
$$
y(t) = Ce^{at}
$$
