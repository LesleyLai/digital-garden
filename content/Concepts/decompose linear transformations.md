# Decompose Linear Transformations
There are *no unique way* to decompose linear transformation, but there are many useful ways:
- [[singular value decomposition|singular value decomposition]] (good for signal processing)
- [[./LU factorization|LU factorization]] (good for solving linear systems)
- [[./polar decomposition|polar decomposition]] (good for spatial transformations)
