**Equivalence relations** are [[./binary relation|binary relations]] that satisfy the following property:

For a relation (denoted as $x \equiv y$ where $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary values in the domain) to be called equivalence relation, they need to satisfy the following property:
- Reflexive: $x \equiv x$
- Symmetric: $x \equiv y \Longleftrightarrow y \equiv x$
- Transitive: $a \equiv b \land b \equiv c \Longleftrightarrow a \equiv c$

[[./identity relation|Strict equivalent]] is just one kind of equivalence. We can also have other kind of equivalence relationship that satisfy the above properties.

> [!example]
> For a set $\{a, b, c\}$, we can have an equivalence relation $a = a,\ b \equiv b,\ c \equiv c,\ b \equiv c,\ c \equiv b$.
