# Temptation bundling

**Temptation bundling** is the technique of linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. It is one way to apply the [[Premack's Principle|Premack's Principle]], which states that more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.

This technique can be combined with [[./habit stacking|habit stacking]] with the following formula:
> 1. After I [current habit], I will [habit I need]
> 2. after [habit I need], I will [habit I want]
