# Divergence

**Divergence** is a [[vector operator|vector operator]] that represents the volume density of the outward [[flux|flux]] of a [[./vector field|vector field]]. 

Divergence takes in a vector-valued function $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}: \mathbb{R}^n): \mathbb{R}^n$ defining this vector field, and outputs a scalar-valued function $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}: \mathbb{R}^n): \mathbb{R}$, where the $\nabla$ is the [[./Del operator|Del operator]] ($\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial u_{1}}, \frac{\partial}{\partial u_{2}}, \frac{\partial}{\partial u_{3}}\right)$) and $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X})$ is the vector field.

## Intuition of Divergence
Intuitively, the divergence measures "how much a vector field is a source or a sink." For example, in the below diagram, the divergence is $1$ for the "source point" and $-1$ for the "sink point".

The divergence would also be positive if the vector field passing through it is speeding up:

## Linking Divergence Definition to Intuition
How does the divergence definition leads to change of volume density? Say we have a 2D function
$$
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}(x, y)=\left[\begin{array}{l}
v_1(x, y) \\
v_2(x, y)
\end{array}\right]
$$
And the formula for its divergence is the following:
$$
\nabla \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v_2}{\partial y}
$$
Let's focus on the $v_1$ component only. Suppose $v_1 = 0$ and $\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} > 0$, we have an outward fluid flow

Suppose $v_1 = 0$ and $\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} < 0$, we have an inward fluid flow

The observation can also generalized to $v_1 \neq 0$, where $\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} > 0$ means more is leaving than is coming in.

And divergence adds contributions of all the axis together:
$$
\nabla \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=\overbrace{\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}}^{\begin{array}{c}
\text{Change in density}\\\text{in the x- direction}
\end{array}}+\underbrace{\frac{\partial v_2}{\partial y}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Change in density } \\
\text { in the } y \text {-direction }
\end{array}}
$$
