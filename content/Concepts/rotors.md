# Rotors

**Rotors** are construct in geometric algebra to represent [[./rotation|rotation]]. It generalizes [[./complex numbers|complex numbers]] and [[quaternions|quaternion]] but can even works on higher dimensions. Even though 3D rotors and quaternions are [[./isomorphism|isomorphic]], rotors are easier to visualize and does not require a fourth dimension or [[stereographic projection|stereographic projection]].

A rotor $\mathbf{a} \mathbf{b}$ is created by [[./geometric product|geometric product]] between two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$: $\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b}$. It represents a rotation **by twice the angle** between vector $\mathbf{a}$ to vector $\mathbf{b}$. To perform rotation with this rotor $\mathbf{a} \mathbf{b}$, we need to multiply it on both sides of the vector we perform a rotation ($\mathbf{b} \mathbf{a}$ is same as $\mathbf{a} \mathbf{b}$ except with the bivector part flipped) [^1]:
$$
\text{rotate}(\mathbf{a} \mathbf{b})(\mathbf{v}) =
\mathbf{b} \mathbf{a} \ \mathbf{v} \ \mathbf{a} \mathbf{b}
$$

This is analogous to the [[quaternions#Quaternion and Rotation|quaternion]], where to perform a rotation we need to apply a quaternion and its conjugate: $q \mathbf{v} q^*$
