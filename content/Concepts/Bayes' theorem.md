The **Bayes' theorem** is the following equation about the [[./conditional probability|conditional probability]] of [[event (probability)|events]]:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$
where $P(B) \neq 0$ and
- $P(A|B)$ is the conditional probability of A given B. It is also called the [[posterior probability|posterior probability]].
- $P(B|A)$ is the conditional probability of B given A.
- $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are known as [[prior probability|prior probability]] or [[marginal probability|marginal probability]]
