# Characteristic Equation
A **characteristic equations** is an equation of degree $n$ upon which depends on the solution of a given $n$th-order [[./differential equations|differential equations]] or [[./difference equations|difference equations]]. The characteristic equations can only formed when the differential or difference equation is [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]], [[./linear differential equation|linear]], and has constant coefficients. [^1]

For a differential equation
$$a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0$$
We will have a characteristic equation of the form
$$
a_n r^{n} + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0
$$
whose solutions $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$ are the roots from which the general solution can be formed. [^1]

## Derivation
Starting with a linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients
$$a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0$$
We can see that $y(x) = e^{rx}$ is a solution because the exponential function $f(x) = e^{rx}$ has the property that its derivative $f'(x) = r e^{rx}$ has the same shape as the original function (see [[Eigenfunction|Eigenfunction]]). In order to solve for $r$, one can substitute $y = e^{rx}$ and its derivatives into the differential equation to get
$$
a_n r^n e^{rx} + a_{n-1}r^{n-1}e^{rx} + \dots + a_1re^{rx} + a_0e^{rx} = 0
$$
Since $e^{rx}$ can never be zero, we can divide it out, and we get the characteristic equation [^1]
$$
a_n r^{n} + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0
$$

## Formation of the General Solution
Solving the characteristic equation allow one to find the general solution of the differential equation. The solution depends on whether the roots are real or complex, and whether there are repeated roots.

### Distinct Real Root
The [[./linear transformation|superposition principle]] of a linear system says that if $u_1, u_2, \dots$ are $n$ [[./linear independence|linearly independent]] solutions to a linear differential equation, then $c_1u_1 + c_2u_2 + \dots + c_nu_n$ is also a solution for all constant values $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$. Thus, if the characteristic equation has distinct real roots $r_1, \dots, r_n$, then a general solution will be of the form
$$
y(x) = c_1 e^{r_1x} + c_2 e^{r_2x} + \dots + c_n e^{r_nx}
$$

\begin{align}
r^2 + 5r + 6 &= 0 & \text{(charastristic equation)} \\
(r + 2)(r + 3) &= 0 \\
r_1 = -2, r_2 = -3 \\
y = c_1 e^{-2x} + c_2 e^{-3x}
\end{align}
>$$

### Repeated Real Root
If the characteristic equation has a root $r_1$ that repeated $k$ times, the general solution that corresponding to $r_1$ is
$$
y(x) = e^{r_1 x} (c_1 + c_2 x + \dots + c_k x^{k-1})
$$

\begin{align}
r^2 + 4r + 4 &= 0 \\
(r + 2)^2 &= 0 \\
r_1 = r_2 = -2
\end{align}
> $$
> thus
> $$
y = c_1 x e^{-2x} + c_2 e^{-2x}
> $$

### Complex Root
What if a root $r = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{ B^2 - 4AC }}{2A}$ is complex? If a second-order differential equation has a characteristic equation with [[complex conjugate|complex conjugate]] roots $r_1 = a + bi$ and $r_2 = a - bi$, then the general solution is $y(x) = c_1e^{(a + bi)x} + c_2e^{(a - bi)x}$. We can simplify it further with [[./Euler's formula|Euler's formula]]:
$$
\begin{align}
y(x) &= c_1e^{(a + bi)x} + c_2e^{(a - bi)x} \\
&= c_1e^{ax} (\cos{bx} + i \sin{bx}) + c_2e^{ax} (\cos{bx} - i \sin{bx}) \\
&=  e^{ax} ((c_1 + c_2)\cos{bx} + i (c_1 - c_2)\sin{bx})
\end{align}
$$
Since $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants that may be complex, we can substitute $c_1 + c_2$ and $i(c_1 - c_2)$ with some other constants. As a result,
$$
y(x) = e^{ax} (C_1\cos{bx} +  C_2\sin{bx})
$$
Note that both $C_1$ and $C_2$ may be complex numbers.
