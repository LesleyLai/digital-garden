**Iterative methods** uses an initial guess to generate a sequence of improving approximate solutions. It is commonly used for problems that may be too complex for direct analytical solutions.

Most iterative methods will run until an _termination condition_ is reached, though some run a deterministic number of steps. In practice, it is also desirable to set a maximum number of iterations even when the termination condition is not met.
