A **proof system** or **proof calculus** is a kind of [[./formal system|formal system]] to prove [[./proposition|statements]].

A proof system consists of the following components:
- [[formal language|formal language]]: for example, [[./propositional logic|propositional logic]] and [[./predicate logic|first-order logic]].
- [[./axiom schemas|axiom schemas]]: fundamental statements or rules accepted as true without proof within the system
- [[./inference rules|inference rules]]: logical rules that allow the derivation of new statements from existing ones
