In statistics, unlike its general use, a **parameter** refers to a number that describes an entire population (e.g., the population mean $\mu$). In contrast, an **estimate** or **statistic** refers to a number derived from a sample, used to approximate the parameter (e.g., the sample mean $\bar{x}$). In other words, the estimate represents what the investigator knows, while the parameter represents what the investigator aims to understand about the population.
