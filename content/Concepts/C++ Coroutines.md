# C++ Coroutines
A coroutine in C++ is an [[finite state machine|finite state machine]] that can be controlled and customized by the `promise_type`.

## Promise Type
A promise type is used to coordinate with coroutines. Unlike the return type, it _resides in the coroutine frame_ and are usually accessed through a pointer (which can be returned by `.promise()` of a coroutine handle)
