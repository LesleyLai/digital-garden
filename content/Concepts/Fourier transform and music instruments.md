Different musical instruments playing the same note (same pitch [[frequency and period of waves|frequency]]) sound completely different (different [[timbre|timbre]]). This is because while the fundamental frequency ([[pitch (music)|pitch]]) might be the same, the [[harmonic|harmonics]] are different!
