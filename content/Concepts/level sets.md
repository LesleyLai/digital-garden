# Level Sets

We can use **level sets** to visualize functions  $f: R^N \rightarrow R$ with multiple inputs and one output. A level set is a subset of the domain given by the implicit equations $f\left(\underline{x}\right) = c$.

Level sets are often denoted as $f^{-1}(c) = \{ x:f\left(\underline{x}\right) = c \}$ even when the function $f$ is not invertible.

In 2D, level sets look like curves on a plane. Those curves are often called contour line or isoline.

In 3D, level sets look liker surfaces in the space. Those surfaces are often called isosurface.
