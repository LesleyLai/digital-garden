# Smooth Functions
A smooth function is a function that has [[./continuous functions|continuous]] [[./derivative|derivatives]].

In multi-variable context, a function $f(x, y)$ is smooth at $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ if all of its partial derivatives $f_{x}, f_{y}$ are continuous in some rectangle centered at $(x_{0}, y_{0})$.
