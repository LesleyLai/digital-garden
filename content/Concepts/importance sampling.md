Importance sampling is a [[./variance reduction methods|variance reduction methods]] technique for [[./Monte Carlo integration|Monte Carlo integration]]. The idea is to put more samples where the [[./probability density function|PDF]] $f(x)$ is bigger.

## Process of Importance Sampling
  1. Having an integral $f(x)$ over the domain $[a, b]$
  2. Pick a [[PDF|PDF]] $p(x)$ that is non-zero over the domain $[a, b]$
  3. We average a bunch of $\frac{f(r)}{p(r)}$ where $r$ is a random number with PDF $p$

  Any choice of PDF $p$ will converge to the correct anwser eventually, but the closer the PDF approximate $f$, the faster we converge.
