The nâ€Š+1 *Bernstein basis polynomials* of degree n are [[./basis|basis]] of polynomials defined as
$$
b_{\nu,n}(x) = \binom{n}{\nu} x^{\nu} \left( 1 - x \right)^{n - \nu}, \quad \nu = 0, \ldots, n,
$$

For example, the first Bernstein basis is $b_{0, 0}(x) = 1$, and the second Bernstein basis are $b_{0, 1}(x) = 1 - x, b_{1, 1}(x) = x$

Bernstein Basis is a good choice of building up curves. For example, [[./Bezier curve|Bezier curve]].
