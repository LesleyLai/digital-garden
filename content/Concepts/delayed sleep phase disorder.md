**Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD)** is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder most commonly observed in adolescents and young adults. Individuals with DSPD typically experience difficulty falling asleep before 2 am or later, significantly later than the conventional bedtime. When allowed to sleep without time constraints, often until as late as 3 pm, these individuals do not experience sleep deprivation. However, when required to wake up earlier, they often suffer from daytime sleepiness, which can negatively impact their performance at work or school.

Unfortunately, people with DSPD are frequently misunderstood and may be perceived as lazy, unmotivated, or poor performers due to their chronic tardiness for morning obligations. However, many individuals with DSPD find that they are most alert, productive, and creative during late night hours, which aligns with their shifted circadian rhythm.
