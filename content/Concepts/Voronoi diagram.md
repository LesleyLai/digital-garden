A **Voronoi diagram** is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. Those objects are often points (called _seeds_ or _sites_). A Voronoi diagram partitions the space so that each region (called **Voronoi cell**) contains all the points closer to one specific seed than to any other seed.

The boundaries between cells have equal distances from their neighboring points.
## Generalizations

Voronoi diagrams aren't limited to just points as seeds, and we can use whatever shapes we want: [^1]

We can also use a different metrics other than the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean distance]] for distance. For example, if we use the [[./Manhattan distance|Manhattan distance]], we get a diagram as the following:

## Creation

A brute-force way to create the Voronoi diagram is to loop through each pixel, and for each pixel loop though each object to see which one is the closest.

The [[jump flooding algorithm|jump flooding algorithm]] is a way to generate a fast approximation of the Voronoi diagram.

## Applications
Voronoi diagrams is widely applicable in Computer Graphics:
- It is useful in [[pathfinding|pathfinding]] as it is dual to [[./Delaunay triangulation|Delaunay triangulation]] [^1]
- It is also useful in [[procedural generation|generating procedural contents]] [^1]
