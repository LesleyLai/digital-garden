# Symmetry of Second Derivatives
The order of the variables in mixed [[./partial derivative|partial derivatives]] doesn't matter _under certain condition_.

> [!theorem] Clairautâ€™s Theorem
> If $f$'s partial derivative up to order 2 exists and are [[./continuous functions|continuous]], then $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$

> [!example]+ Example: if $f(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2}$
> then
> $$
> \begin{align}
> f_{yx} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = (4xy)e^{x^2 + y^2} \\
> f_{xy} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} = (4xy)e^{x^2 + y^2}
> \end{align}
> $$
