# G.I. Joe Fallacy
**G.I. Joe fallacy** is the mistaken idea that "knowing is half the battle". However, Merely knowing something is not enough to put into practice. For example,  you can't teach yourself to unsee [[optical illusion|optical illusions]] even if you learned them.

The name of the fallacy comes from the cartoon _G.I. Joe_.
