One inefficient study method preferred by students is to repeatedly reread sources. It is an example of [[./overlearning|overlearning]] and can creates an [[./illusion of progress|illusion of progress]] after the source start to feel familiar. And [[./mere exposure effect|it is easy to conflate familiarity with understanding]].

Employing repeatedly rereading strategy also indicate a fundamental misconception of memory. We like to view [[human memory does not work like a tape recorder or camera|memory as an "unreliable camera"]] (think about Monte Carlo Simulation) which will eventually converge to understanding if we spend enough time rereading,

The correct mental model for our memory is that it actively [[reconstructive memory|reconstructs]] the source base on prior knowledge. To construct our own understanding, we can make questions while reading to force ourselves to think in our own words and draw in prior knowledge. A technique called [[./elaborative interrogation|elaborative interrogation]] is a great way to formalize this process.
