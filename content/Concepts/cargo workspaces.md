# Cargo Workspace

A workspace is a set of packages shares the same `Cargo.lock` and the same `output` directory. There are multiple ways to structure a workspace, but here is one common way:

To start, add the following lines to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
]
```
Next, weâ€™ll create the `adder` binary crate by running `cargo new`:

```console
$ cargo new adder
     Created binary (application) `adder` package
```
