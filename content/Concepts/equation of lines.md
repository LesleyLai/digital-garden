## Parametric Form
In parametric form, a line is defined as a starting point $\mathbf{p_0}$ and direction $\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{p_0}$
$\mathbf{p}(t) = \mathbf{p_0} + t \ (\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{p_0})$

## Symmetric Equation
**symmetric equations** or **non-parametric equations** of a line looks like this
$$
\frac{3}{2}(x + 1) = 3y = \frac{3}{2}(z - 2)
$$
We can get such an equation from a parametric equation by calculating $t$ in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively.
