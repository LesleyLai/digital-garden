**Sinc filter** is an ideal [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] with no frequencies above cutoff.

Its [[impulse response|impulse response]] is a [[./sinc function|sinc function]] in [[time and frequency domain|time domain]]:
$$
\frac{ \sin(\pi t)}{\pi t}
$$

Sinc filter has the property of "infinite extent": the oscillation goes on forever.
