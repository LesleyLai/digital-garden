# Ecological Correlation
An **ecological correlation** (also **spatial correlation**) is a [[correlation|correlation]] between two variables that are group [[mean|mean]], in contrast to a correlation between two variables that describe individuals. [^1]

Ecological correlations tend to **overestimate (inflate) the strength of association** between the two variables.
