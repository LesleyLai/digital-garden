# Spatial Transformation
A [[spatial transformation|spatial transformation]] in n dimension is a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$.

A lot of spatial transformations can be represented as [[./linear transformation|linear transformations]].

There are several types of spatial transformations like [[./translation|translation]], [[./rotation|rotation]], [[./scaling|scaling]], and [[./sheering|sheering]]. The type of spatial transformations is decided by the **invariant** they maintain. For example, rotation keeps origin fixed, preserves distances, and preserves orientation.
