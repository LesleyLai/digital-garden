`std::mem::transmute` can be used for bit cast in Rust
```rust
let a: f32 = 42.42;
let frankentype: u32 = unsafe {
  std::mem::transmute(a)
};
```

## Why is Transmute Unsafe
I had a brain rot about why transmute is unsafe. This is because you can have a bit pattern that does not represent a valid value of the target type. This makes me wish that Rust has "conditional unsafe" for generic functions.
