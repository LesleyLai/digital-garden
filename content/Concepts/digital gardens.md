> Almost all digital gardens have a page explaining what is a "digital garden"

A **digital garden** is an online space where individuals share their notes and ideas. We can also see it as a **personal wiki**.

It sits at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share incomplete or evolving thoughts that are refined over time. Unlike traditional blogs, which typically feature polished posts, digital gardens often contain unfinished articles that undergo significant updates. This evolving nature gives rise to the term "digital garden," as the content "grows" rather than remaining static.

Another feature of a digital garden is its navigation structure. While blogs are typically arranged chronologically, digital gardens are more loosely organized and rely heavily on hyperlinks for navigation, just like traditional wikis.
