title: Orthogonality of Vectors
---
We say that two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are **orthogonal** if their [[./dot product|dot product]] is zero ($\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$).

More generally, two vectors are [[orthogonal|orthogonal]] with respect to the [[./inner product space|inner product space]] if $\langle \mathbf{u},\, \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0$.

Notice that two vector orthogonal in one inner product space may not necessarily orthogonal to each other with a different inner product.
