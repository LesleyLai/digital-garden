# Reading MOC

There are multiple levels of reading. When we read casually for entertainment or information, we can stop at passively reading. However, reading for understanding requires more mental effort and engagement. A heuristic is that "anything easily digested is reading for information."

We can also adopt [[./the barbell method of reading|the barbell method of reading]] for hard to grasp materials (read twice). Another advice of engaging more with the book is to *annotate and comment* about the book whether it is physical or ebook. [^marginalia]
