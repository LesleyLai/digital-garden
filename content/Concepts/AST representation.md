# AST Representation

There are several ways to have typed information to AST [^typed]:
- mutable AST (with optional type field later field)
- having a separated typed AST
- generic AST
- relational AST (akin to [[data oriented design|data oriented design]])


Here is various pages describing AST representation in production systems:
- [Persistence, façades and Roslyn’s red-green trees | Fabulous adventures in coding](https://ericlippert.com/2012/06/08/red-green-trees/)
- [rust-analyzer/syntax.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/syntax.md)
- [Swift Syntax and Structured Editing Library](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/5e2c815edfd758f9b1309ce07bfc01c4bc20ec23/lib/Syntax)

The following articles also provide good information on AST representation
