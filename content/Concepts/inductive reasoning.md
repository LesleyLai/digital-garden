# Inductive Reasoning

> [!tip] Not to be confused with [[mathematical induction|mathematical induction]]

**Inductive reasoning** is a form of [[logical reasoning|inference]] that uses past experiences to make future predictions because future is likely to resemble the past. Unlike [[./deductive reasoning|deductive reasoning]], inductive reasoning can't provide certainly, and is instead speak in term of probability. In other word. inductive premises can't guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

> Therefore, Socrates probably had a beard.

Compare to deductive reasoning, a problem with induction reasoning is that it can always provide false conclusions.
