# Pearson Correlation Coefficient

the **Pearson correlation coefficient**, also known as _Pearson'sÂ r_, is a correlation coefficient that measures linear correlation between two sets of data. [^1]

> [!definition]
> Given two random variables $X$ and $Y$, the Pearson correlation coefficient is often denoted as $\rho_{XY}$ and is defined as
>$$
\rho_{XY} = \frac{\text{Cov}[X, Y]}{\text{stdev}[X]\text{stdev}[Y]}
>$$
>where
> - $\text{Cov}[X, Y]$ is the [[covariance|covariance]] between $X$ and $Y$
> - $\text{stdev}[X]$ and $\text{stdev}[Y]$ are the [[standard deviation|standard deviation]] of $X$ and $Y$

Note that the above ratio is only well-defined when $\text{stdev}[X]$ and $\text{stdev}[Y]$ are both greater than zero. However, it is often assumed that the correlation is 0 when one of the standard deviations is 0 (in which case $Cov[X, Y]$ will also be zero).
