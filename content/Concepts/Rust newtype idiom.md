In Rust, the **newtype idiom** wraps an underlying types with another type to enforce correct usage. E.g.
```rust
struct Years(i64);
struct Days(i64);

impl Days {
    /// truncates partial years
    pub fn to_years(&self) -> Years {
        Years(self.0 / 365)
    }
}
```

The newtype idiom can also be a useful way to circumvent the [[./orphan rule|orphan rule]].

## Conversions
see: [[./Rust conversions|Rust conversions]]

We can implement `From` or `TryFrom` to convert from primitives to newtype. And `AsRef` is useful to implement for code to consume new types as primitives.
