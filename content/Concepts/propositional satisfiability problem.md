The **propositional satisfiability problem**, also called **boolean satisfiability problem**, and abbreviated as **SAT**, is the problem of determining whether a set of propositions is [[satisfiability|satisfiable]]. [^1]

In practice, many automated reasoning problems in propositional logic are first reduced to satisfiability problems and then by using a [[SAT solver|SAT solver]]. [^1]
