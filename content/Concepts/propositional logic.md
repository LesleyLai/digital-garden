# Propositional Logic

**Propositional logic** is a branch of logic which studies the logical relationships between [[./proposition|propositions]] taken as a whole, and connected via logical [[./logical connective|connectives]].

## Definition
- [[./proposition|Proposition]]: something that can be true or false
  - can be [[premise|premises]] or conclusion
- Truth Value: each of a proposition have a **truth value** of either **true** and **false**
- [[./logical connective|Connectives]]: relationships (such as *and* and *or*) between propositions
- [[./argument|Argument]]: a sequence of propositions, with the last being the conclusion and the others being premises

## Logical Properties
- [[./validity (logic)|validity]] and [[./deductive soundness|soundness]]
- [[satisfiability|satisfiability]]
- [[tautology|tautology]]
- [[./logical equivalence|logical equivalence]]
