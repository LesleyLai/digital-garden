**Propositional logic** is a branch of logic which studies the logical relationships between [[./proposition|propositions]] taken as a whole, and connected via logical [[./logical connective|connectives]].

## Definition
- [[./proposition|Proposition]]: something that can be true or false
  - can be [[premise|premises]] or conclusion
- Truth Value: each of a proposition have a **truth value** of either **true** and **false**
  - [[interpretations (logic)|Truth Assignment]]: a function assigning a truth value to each of the proposition constants
- [[./logical connective|Connectives]]: relationships (such as *and* and *or*) between propositions
- [[./argument|Argument]]: a sequence of propositions, with the last being the conclusion and the others being premises

## Connectives
The five main connectives in propositional logic are [[negation|negation]] ($\neg P$), [[disjunction|disjunction]] ($P \lor Q$), [[conjunction|conjunction]] ($P \land Q$), [[./logical conditional|conditional]] ($P \to Q$), and [[./logical biconditional|biconditional]] ($P \leftrightarrow Q$). Other connectives such as [[./exclusive or|exclusive or]] can be derived from the above connectives.
