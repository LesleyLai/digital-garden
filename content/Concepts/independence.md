## Independent Events

Two events are called **independent** if  $P(A \cap B)=P(A) P(B)$, or equivalently, the [[./conditional probability|conditional probability]] $P(A \mid B)=P(A)$. 

Intuitively, $A$ and $B$ are independent means that observing $B$ does not have any effect on the probability of $A$.
