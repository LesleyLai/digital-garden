# Bounded Set

A set $S$ is *bounded* if it has both upper and lower bounds. For example, a set of real number is bounded if it is contained in an finite interval.

## In Real
A subset $X$ of the real line is said to be bounded if we have $X \subset [-M, M]$ for some real number $M > 0$.

## In Metric Space
Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, and let $Y$ be a subset of $X$. We say that $Y$ is bounded *iff* there exists a [[./ball (topology)|ball]] $B(x, r)$ in $X$ which contains $Y$.
