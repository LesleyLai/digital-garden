The **Gibbs phenomenon** describes the behavior observed in truncated Fourier series approximations of functions with [[types of discontinuities in functions|jump discontinuities]]. Even as the number of terms ($N$) in the series becomes large, there is an overshoot that approaches approximately 9% of the jump height on either side of the discontinuity.
