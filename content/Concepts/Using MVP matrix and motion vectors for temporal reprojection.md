We also call this approach the "Rasterization" approach. The idea is that in vertex shader, transform vertices with two matrices
- The current [[./Model-View-Projection Matrix|MVP]]
- The previous MVP
The difference is the (linear) [[Motion Vectors|motion vectors]] for each vertex. We can [[./barycentric coordinates|interpolate them over triangles]] to get the motion vector per fragment.
