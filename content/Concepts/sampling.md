**Sampling** encompasses a range of interrelated concepts across different fields, each applying it uniquely to solve specific problems. Despite these variations, they share a common underlying principle: the extraction of representative, discrete subsets (samples) from larger, sometimes continuous, entities.

- [[./sampling (signal processing)|In signal processing]], sampling is the reduction of a continuous signal to a [[./discrete signals and systems|discrete signal]].
- [[sampling (statistics)|In statistics]], sampling is the selection of a subset of individuals from within a population to estimate characteristics of the whole population.
- [[pseudo-random number sampling|pseudo-random number sampling]], which generate pseudo-random numbers from a probability distribution

The core idea of sampling is interconnected across disciplines. For example, in [[./Monte Carlo methods|Monte Carlo simulation]], the concept of random sampling can be interpreted as both a signal processing technique and a statistical method.
