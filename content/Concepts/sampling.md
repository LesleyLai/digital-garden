# Sampling

**Sampling** encodes signal as discrete set of samples. The reverse process is called [[./sample reconstruction|reconstruction]].

## Concepts
- [[./aliasing|aliasing]]
- [[./sample reconstruction|reconstruction]]
- [[./variance|variance]]

## Pseudo Random Number Sampling Methods
## Uniform
- [[./generating uniform distributed integer|generating uniform distributed integer]]

### Non-uniform
#### Discrete
- Linear search or binary search on weights
- [[alias method|alias method]]
#### Continuous
- [[rejection sampling|rejection sampling]]
- [[./inverse transform sampling|inverse transform sampling]]
- [[./transformation of random variables|transformation of random variables]]
