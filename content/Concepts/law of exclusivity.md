# Law of Exclusivity
**Law of exclusivity** means that we need exclusive access when mutating an object.

Consequences:
- While reading an object, nobody can change it
- While mutating an object, nobody can read or change it

With law of exclusivity hold, we don't need explicit synchronization since we can have have [[./synchronization quadrant|shared mutable data]].

[[./value-oriented programming|Value-oriented programming]] is a paradigm that enforce the law of exclusivity, and [[./Rust borrow checker|Rust borrow checker]] also enforce that.
