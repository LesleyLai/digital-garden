# Bias and Fallacies in Statistics and Probability
- [[./confounding variable|confounding variable]] - treatment and the control group differ in some third variable which influences the response that is being studied
- [[selection bias|selection bias]] - when some participants are more likely to be chosen to be in the study than others
  - e.g. a hospital may select healthier subjects for surgery
- [[observer bias|observer bias]] - when the participants or investigators are aware of the identity of the 2 groups, and so we can get bias in either the responses or evaluations
  - [[placebo effect|placebo effect]]
- [[consent bias|consent bias]] - participants choose whether or not they take part in the experiment
- [[survivorship bias|survivor bias]] - when only certain types of participants finish the study
- [[adherence bias|adherer]] - when participants who adhere to a study protocol or intervention differ from those who do not adhere
- [[sampling bias|sampling bias]]
- [[ecological correlation|ecological fallacy]] - the interpretation of statistical data that occurs when inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inferences about the group to which those individuals belong

## Probability Bias
- [[./base rate fallacy|base rate bias]]
  - also called *prosecutor's Fallacy*, can be viewed as confusion of the  probability $P(A | B)$ with the probability $P(B | A)$
