Generic questions in small talk such as "what is your favorite movie" is hard to answer and can be a conversation stopper. Instead, adding "lately" to the question makes it much more assessable. "What is your favorite movie *lately*" is a lot easier to answer since it narrows down the choices and makes the answer  much less significant. Also, leave interpretation space for "lately" rather than making it specific. [^1]
