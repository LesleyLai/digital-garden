# Focused and Diffuse Modes of Thinking
Our brains operate in two distinct modes of thinking: **focused** and **diffuse**. Focused thinking involves concentrated attention on a specific [[neural pathway|neural pathway]], making it effective for solving familiar problems. In contrast, diffuse thinking is a more relaxed approach that allows for seeing connections within larger contexts.
