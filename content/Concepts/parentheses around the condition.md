# Parentheses Around the Condition

To disambiguous parsing of if expression, some delimitator need to be added between `if` and condition. Different languages uses different solutions. Most C-style languages require parenthesis around condition like this
```c
if (cond) block;
```
Even though the first `(` is not useful.

Alternatively, languages like [[go|go]] or [[./Rust|Rust]] requires braces around statements.
```rust
if cond { statements; }
```

And some other languages like ML or [[./Python|Python]] requires a `then` keyword or some other delimitator token.
```ocaml
if cond then e1 else e2
```
