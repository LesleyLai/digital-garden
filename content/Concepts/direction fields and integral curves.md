A **direction field** for a [[first-order ordinary differential equation|first-order ODE]] $y' = f(x, y)$ is an 2D graph where at each point $(x, y)$ of the plane. we drawn a little line segment whose slope is $f(x, y)$.

To construct a direction field by hand, we can draw **isoclines** for the equation which are curves given by $f(x, y) = k, k = \text{constant}$.
