# C & C++ Incompatibilities
  There are several incompatibilities between C and C++ that we need to consider when porting a C codebase to C++:
  - C11 [[./Type-generic macro|type-generic macro]] is not supported in C++
  - C++ has more strict [[./Strict aliasing|aliasing rule]], and it can impact codes performing [[./Type Punning|type punning]].
