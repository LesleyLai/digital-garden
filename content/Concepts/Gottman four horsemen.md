# Gottman's Four Horsemen

The Psychologist [[John Gottman|John Gottman]] developed "**the four horsemen**" [^1] that detriments relationship.

The four horsemen are particular types of negative interactions during conflict, which involves criticism, [[contempt|contempt]], defensiveness, and stonewalling.

- Criticism
- Contempt means *a sense of superiority* toward the other person. It can be sarcasm, negative humor.
- Defensiveness
- Stonewalling

Among these four, Gottman considers contempt the most destructive of them all.
