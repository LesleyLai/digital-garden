# Geometry Processing
Geometry processing is an area for manipulation and analysis of [[./3d geometry representation|3d geometry]].

A lot of geometry processing tasks are similar to traditional [[./signal processing|signal processing]] tasks such as filtering, reconstruction, down sampling, up sampling, and compression. However, there are also unique tasks such as flattening a surface and resampling.
