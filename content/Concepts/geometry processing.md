Geometry processing is an area for manipulation and analysis of [[./geometry representations|3d geometry]].

A lot of geometry processing tasks are similar to traditional [[./signal processing|signal processing]] tasks such as [[filter (signal processing)|filtering]], [[./sample reconstruction|reconstruction]], down sampling, up sampling, and compression. However, there are also unique tasks such as flattening a surface and resampling.

## Geometry Representations
See: [[./geometry representations|3d geometry]]

There are a lot of way to represent geometries, which we can roughly categorize into implicit or explicit. [[./triangle mesh|Triangle mesh]] is the most commonly used representation.
