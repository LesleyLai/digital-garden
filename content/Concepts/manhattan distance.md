# Manhattan Distance

The **Manhattan distance**, also called **taxicab metric** or **L1 distance**, of two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, is defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^n |u_i - v_i|
\end{equation*}
$$

If we only consider one vector $\mathbf{u}$ and origin, we get *L1 norm* or *taxicab norm*.
