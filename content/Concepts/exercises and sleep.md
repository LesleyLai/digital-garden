Regular physical activity is known to improve sleep quality, increase total sleep duration, and reduce the time it takes to fall asleep. [^2]

It is often recommended to avoid exercising close to bedtime. The evidence in this area is mixed. Some research suggests that exercise can influence the circadian rhythm, with late-night workouts potentially _delaying_ it. [^1] On the other hand, other studies conclude that light bodyweight resistance exercises in the evening may actually enhance sleep quality. [^3]
