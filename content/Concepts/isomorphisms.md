# Isomorphisms
Let $G=(G, \star)$ and $H=(H, *)$ be [[./group|groups]]. A [[bijection|bijection]] $\phi: G \rightarrow H$ is called an *isomorphism* if
$$
\phi\left(g_{1} \star g_{2}\right)=\phi\left(g_{1}\right) * \phi\left(g_{2}\right) \quad \text { for all } g_{1}, g_{2} \in G .
$$

If there exists an isomorphism from $G$ to $H$, then we say $G$ and $H$ are *isomorphic* and write $G \cong H$.
