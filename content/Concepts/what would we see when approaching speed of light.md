# What Would We See when Approaching Speed of light

We will see various [[optical phenomena|optical phenomena]] when we get faster and faster.

First, stars that we are approaching seems to move away and the sky contracts before us. This phenomenon is called [[aberration|aberration]] and it is caused by the higher density of light in front of us.

And then there is the [[doppler effect|doppler effect]]: if we move away from earth, light from earth takes longer and longer to reach us, so the earth looks like in slow motion. Also, since the wavelength of light from earth increases, we will also observe [[redshift|redshift]] when looking at earth. In front of us is exactly opposite with clocks seems run faster and color shifts to blue.

When we move close to light speed, we will observe the relativistic effect of [[time dilation|time dilation]] and [[length contraction|length contraction]]. The effect of length contraction can also be understood as [[Terrell-Penrose rotation|Terrell-Penrose rotation]], where passing objects seems to distort in shape.
