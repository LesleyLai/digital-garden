# Rank

The **rank of a matrix** $A$ is the [[./dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of the [[./vector space|vector space]] generated by its columns (a.k.a. the [[./column space|column space]]). In other words, it is the max number of the [[./linear independence|linearly independent]] *columns* of a matrix.

> [!note]
>  it can be shown that the max number of the linear independence *rows* of a matrix is equal to the rank, so we don't need to distinguish between "row rank" and "column rank."

## Properties
- $\text{rank}(A + B) \leq \text{rank}(A) + \text{rank}(B)$
- $\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}(A^T) = \text{rank}(A^TA) = \text{rank}(\mathcal{A}^T)$
- $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is [[./matrix inverse|invertible]] **iff** $\text{rank}(A) = n$
