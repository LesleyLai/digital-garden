A **system** can be viewed as a black box that takes [[./signal|signals]] as input and produces signals as output.

## Classification of Systems
- [[./linear system|linear vs nonlinear]]
- [[./time invariant system|time invariant vs time varying]]
- [[./causal system|causal vs noncausal]]
- continuous vs [[./discrete signals and systems|discrete]]
- [[invertible systems|invertible vs noninvertible]]
- [[internal and external stability of a system|stable vs unstable]]

One of the most widely studied type of systems is the [[./linear time-invariant system|linear time-invariant (LTI) system]].
