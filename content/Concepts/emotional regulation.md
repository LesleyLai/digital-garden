# Emotion Regulation
**Emotion regulation** is the capacity to manage and control one's emotional state.

Two of the ways to regulate emotions
- down regulation: reduce intensity of emotion
- up regulation: amplify one's emotion

Psychologist [[James Gross|James Gross]] highlights that people can exert control over their emotions at various times—prior to experiencing an emotion ("antecedent-focused emotion regulation") and after they've already initiated an emotional response ("response-focused emotion regulation").
