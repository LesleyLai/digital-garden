# Information Distilling
**Distilling** is the process of making knowledge "time travel" well.

We need to make note easily graspable for our future self so we don't need to reread the source material. Striking a balance between concise representation and preserving context is challenging. Additionally, we can't invest excessive time in note-taking.

> [!note] Common signs that knowledge doesn't time travel well
> 1. I read an insightful article and think it may be handy. When the time come to do the task, I need to reread the whole source material
> 2. I read my old note and have no idea what it means
