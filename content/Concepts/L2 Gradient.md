# L2 Gradient

Consider a function of a function $F(f)$, what is its derivative?

We can't use take [[partial derivative|partial derivative]] anymore!

But we can still use the [[./directional derivative|directional derivative]] definition.
Look for function $\nabla F$ such that for all functions $u$,

$$
  \langle\nabla F,\,u\rangle = D_u F
$$
