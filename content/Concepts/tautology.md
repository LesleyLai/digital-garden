In [[./propositional logic|propositional logic]], a [[well-formed formula|formula]] $\varphi$ is a **tautology** [[./entailment and provability|if it is truth for every]] [[interpretations (logic)|interpretation]]. I.e.
$$
x \vDash \varphi, \text{for every assignment x}.
$$
In languages other than propositional logic, this concept can be generalize into [[./validity (disambiguous)|valid formula]].
