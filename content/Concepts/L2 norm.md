# L2 Norm
**L2 norm** is also called **Euclidean norm**.

## In Cartesian Coordinates
$$   
\begin{equation*}
|\mathbf{u}| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2}
\end{equation*}
$$

## L2 Norm of Functions
For real-valued functions on the unit interval $[0, 1]$ whose square has a well-defined integral. The L2 norm is defined as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
||f|| := \sqrt{ \int_0^1 f(x)^2 dx }
\end{equation*}
$$

Something slightly fishy about this one on satisfying properties of a [[./norm|norm]].
