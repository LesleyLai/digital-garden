A **block diagram** is a visual representation of a [[./systems|system]]. It uses blocks to represent system components and arrows to show the flow of signals or information between these components.

Compared to [[./difference equations|difference equations]] or [[./differential equations|differential equations]], which are declarative descriptions of a system, a block diagram is more imperative and operational in nature. Block diagrams can often be more directly translated into a hardware or software implementation.
