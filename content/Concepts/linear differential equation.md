# Linear Differential Equation
A **linear differential equation** is a differential equation in the form of
$$
a_0(x)y + a_1(x)y' + a_2(x)y'' \cdots + a_n(x)y^{(n)} = b(x)
$$

> [!example]+
> $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$ is non-linear since the term $u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$ is not linear
