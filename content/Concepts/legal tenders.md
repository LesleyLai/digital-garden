**Legal tender** is any currency declared legal by a government. Courts of law are required to recognize it as satisfactory payment for any monetary debt. [^1]

Coins and [[./bank note|banknotes]] are examples of legal tender in many countries, but personal checks, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are usually not. [^1]
