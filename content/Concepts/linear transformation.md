A function $f$ is **linear** if it maps _vectors to vectors_, and if for all vectors $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{v}$ and scalers $a$ we have
$$
\begin{align*}
     f(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) &= f(\mathbf{u}) + f(\mathbf{v}) & \text{(additive)} \\
     f(a\mathbf{u}) &= af(\mathbf{u}) & (\text{homogeneity})
\end{align*}
$$
In other word, whether we add the vectors and then apply the map, or apply the map and then add the vectors gives the same result.

The above property is sometimes called the **superposition principle** in physics and engineering.

For example, the function $f(x)=ax+bf(x)=ax+b$ is not a linear function, but instead an [[./affine function|affine function]].

## Geometric Intuition
A linear map must have a _fixed origin_ and _lines must map into lines_.

## Usefulness
The property of linear transformation has a few advantages:
- computationally it is much easier to solve [[./system of linear equation|system of linear equation]] than the nonlinear ones
- Linear transformations can be composed as matrix multiplication
- All maps can be approximated as linear maps over a short distance/time ([[Taylor's theorem|Taylor's theorem]])
