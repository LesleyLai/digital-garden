In database theory, **functional dependencies (FDs)** are a tool to capture semantic relationships between attributes and detect and eliminate bad design.

Informally, a function dependency $X \to Y$ is _when value of attribute X determines the value of attribute Y_. 

More formally, 
> [!definition] Functional dependencies
> given a [[./relation|relation]] $R$ and two set of attributes $X, Y \subseteq R$, we say "$X$ **functionally determines** $Y$" or if each $X$ value is associated with precisely one $Y$ value. 

$R$ is then said to _satisfy_ the functional dependency $X \to Y$. In other word, the relationship $R$ between $X$ and $Y$ can be modelled using a [[function|function]] (many-to-one).

## Determining Functional Dependencies
There are two ways to determine functional dependency, either via considering semantic meaning of the attributes or by analyzing the actual data.

In most cases, we use the semantic meaning. And if we use the actual data, this process is referred to as [[knowledge mining|knowledge mining]].

## Inference Rules
Given $A$, $B$, and $C$ as sets of attributes in a relation $R$, there are several properties of functional dependencies. The most important three are [[Armstrong's axioms|Armstrong's axioms]]
1. **Reflexivity**: If $B \subseteq A$, then $A \to B$
  - These are called *trivial* functional dependencies
2. **Augmentation**: If $A \to B$, then $AC \to BC$ for any set of attributes $C$
3. **Transitivity**: If $A \to B$ and $B \to C$, then $A \to C$

### Closure
Given a set of functional dependencies $F$, we call the set of all functional dependences that can be deduced form the set $F$ a **closure** and denote it as $F^+$.

Using the definition of closure, we can say that the Armstrong's axioms is [[./soundness (formal system)|sound]] and [[./completeness|complete]].
- sound: they generate only functional dependencies in $F^+$
- complete: they generate all functional dependencies in $F^+$
