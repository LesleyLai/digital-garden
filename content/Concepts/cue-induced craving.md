# Cue-induced craving

Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. **Cue-induced craving** refers to a phenomenon where individuals experience an intense desire or craving for a substance, such as cocaine, when exposed to specific [[./habit cue|cues]] or triggers associated with that substance.

For example, the [['Atomic Habits' Notes#Chapter 7 The Secret of Self Control|"Atomic Habits" book]] mentions that [[addiction|addiction]] can spontaneously dissolve if there are drastic environmental change. For example, a large numbers of U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War struggle from heroin addiction. Surprisingly, upon returning home, many of these addictions naturally waned. In contrast, individuals who underwent rehabilitation often found themselves relapsing upon going back into their former environments.
