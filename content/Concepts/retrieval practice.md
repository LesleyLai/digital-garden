**Retrieval practice** is the strategy of pulling information from our own mind without looking up source materials. It is based to **the testing effect**, which suggests [[long-term memory|long-term memory]] is increased when part of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory.

[[./flashcards|Flashcards]], [[./recall|recalling]], and testing are a popular method of retrieval practice.

Both success and failure to retrieve information are helpful since both calibrate our confidence in our perception of understanding. [^1]

Retrieval practice is different from typical school tests because its purpose is to produce learning rather than to assess it. [^2]
