The **time domain** refers to the analysis of [[./signal|signals]] with respect to time. When the signal's domain is space instead of time, we use the term **spatial domain** instead.

The **frequency domain** refers to the analysis of signals with respect to [[frequency and period of waves|frequency]] rather than time or space. It typically shows how the [[./size of a signal|signal's energy or power]] is distributed across various frequencies. [[phase (waves)|Phase]] information can also be represented in the frequency domain.

The domain terminology is related to the domain (set of inputs) of a [[./functions|function]].

To convert a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, you can use methods such as [[Fourier transform|Fourier transform]], [[./Laplace transform|Laplace transform]], or [[Z-transform|Z-transform]].
