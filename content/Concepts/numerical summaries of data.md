A numerical summary reduces all the data to simple numbers ("**statistic**"). This loses a lot of information. However, it allows for easy communication and comparisons.

Major features that we can use include:
- center: [[mean|mean]] and [[median|median]]
- spread: [[./variance|variance]] and [[standard deviation|standard deviation]]
- [[quantiles|quantiles]] beside median: [[percentile|percentile]]

## Correlation
- [[./Pearson correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]]

## Errors
- [[residual (statistics)|residual]]
- [[./root mean square error|root mean square error]]
