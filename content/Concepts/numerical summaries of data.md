# Numerical Summaries of Data

A numerical summary reduces all the data to simple numbers ("statistic"). This loses a lot of information. However, it allows for easy communication and comparisons.

Major features that we can use include:
- maximum/minimum
- center (mean, median)
- spread (standard deviation, range, IQR)

## Center
- [[mean|mean]]
- [[median|median]]

## Spread
- [[./variance|variance]] and [[standard deviation|standard deviation]]

## Correlation
- [[./Pearson correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]]

## Errors
- [[residual (statistics)|residual]]
- [[./root mean square error|root mean square error]]
