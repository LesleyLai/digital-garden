A numerical summary reduces all the data to simple numbers. This loses a lot of information. However, it allows for easy communication and comparisons.

Depending on whether we are referring to a population or a sample, these numbers will either be [[./statistical parameters and estimates|parameters or estimates]].

Major features that we can use include:
- center: [[mean|mean]] and [[median|median]]
- spread: [[./variance|variance]] and [[standard deviation|standard deviation]]
- [[quantile|quantile]] beside median: [[percentile|percentile]]

## Correlation

## Errors
