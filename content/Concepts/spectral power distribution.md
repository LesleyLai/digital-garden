# Spectral Power Distribution
_Spectral power distribution_ (SPD) can refer to the concentration, as a function of wavelength, of any [[./radiometry quantities|radiometric]] or photometric quantities (e.g. [[./radiance|radiance]], [[./irradiance|irradiance]], [[radiant energy|radiant energy]], or [[./radiant flux|radiant flux]])

We often approximate spectral power distribution as RGB.
