**Biconditional**, also called **material equivalence**, is a logical connective that means "$P$ if and only if $Q$".

> [!info] Not to be confused with [[./equivalence relation|equivalence relation]] and [[./logical equivalence|logical equivalence]]

Biconditional has the following truth table:

| $\alpha$ | $\beta$ | $\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta$ |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| T        | T       | T                              |
| T        | F       | F                              |
| F        | T       | F                              |
| F        | F       | T                              |
Alternative symbols of biconditional include $\iff$ (`\iff` in latex) and $\equiv$ (`\equiv` in latex). Though those symbols are also used to express [[./logical equivalence|logical equivalence]]. The meaning of symbols depend on context. The phrase "if and only if" or "iff" is also often used.

## Relationship with Logical Equivalence
See: [[./logical equivalence|logical equivalence]]

Biconditional and logical equivalence has close relation, but they are not the same. When $P$ and $Q$ are logical equivalent, the biconditional $P \leftrightarrow Q$ is always true (a [[tautology|tautology]]).
