# Falsifiability
The criterion of **falsifiability** serves as a [[./deductive reasoning|deductive]] standard for assessing the legitimacy of purported scientific theories and hypotheses. Coined by Karl Popper, this concept states that a theory is **falsifiable** if it can be logically contradicted through empirical testing. [^1]
