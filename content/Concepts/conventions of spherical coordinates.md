Note that there are two set of convention for spherical coordinates, "physics convention" or "mathematical convention":

| physics convention | mathematics convention |
| ---- | ---- |
| ![[../Spherical coordinates 1.svg|Spherical coordinates 1.svg]] | ![[../3D_Spherical_2.svg|3D_Spherical_2.svg]] |
| polar angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ | The meanings of $\theta$ and $\phi$ is swapped |
