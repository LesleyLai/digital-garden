**Metacognition** is the capacity to evaluate the success of one's own cognitive processes in various domains. In the context of learning, it involves planning, monitoring, and evaluating how well you're progressing. [^1]

Some metacognitive strategies include:
- Identifying what you already know and what you still need to learn
- Planning how to acquire the knowledge you're missing
- [[./illusion of progress|Evaluating]] your progress and adjusting your approach as needed

Unfortunately, most [[./people lack the metacognitive skills to learn effectively|people lack the metacognitive skills to learn effectively]], and these skills need to be explicitly taught and practiced.

Metacognitive skills can also be somewhat domain-specific, and proficiency in one area doesn't necessarily transfer fully to others without additional training. [^2]
