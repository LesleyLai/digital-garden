# Blank Sheet Reading Method
1. Before start a reading session, pull out a blank sheet of paper and write down what you know about the subject
2. After the reading session spend a few minutes adding to the paper (use a different ink)
3. Before the next reading, review the blank sheet
4. Store the sheet somewhere and review them

Combining this method and [[./progressive summarization|progressive summarization]] can be a great way to write [[./literature notes|literature notes]].
