# Rust Anyhow
`anyhow` is a rust library to type erase different error types. This simplifies error propagation in user code.

## Context
We can wrap an `anyhow::Result` with additional context information with `.context()`:
```rust
result.context("additional info")
```

There is also a lazy version `.with_context()`:
```rust
result.with_context(|| format!("Failed to read instrs from {}", path.display()))
```
