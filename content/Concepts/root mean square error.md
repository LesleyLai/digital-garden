The **root mean square error** (**RMS Error**), or **root mean square deviation**, is a measure of the differences between predicted values and observed values.

$$
\text{RMS}_{\text{error}} = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2}{n} }
$$
where $e_i$ are the [[residual (statistics)|residuals]] (difference between the observed value and the estimated value) for each data point.

> Similar to [[./variance|variance]], RMS error use the mean of the squared residuals. Using just the mean of the residuals in linear regression would always result in zero.

## RMS Error in Linear Regression
In [[linear regression|linear regression]], a quick formula to calculate the RMS Error is
$$
\text{RMS}_{\text{error}} = \sqrt{ 1-r^2 } \ \text{SD}_{y}
$$
where $r$ is the [[./Pearson correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]].

We can see that with perfect correlation (i.e. $r = \pm1$), RMS Error is 0. And when $r = 0$, RMS Error is the standard deviation of the dependent variable.
