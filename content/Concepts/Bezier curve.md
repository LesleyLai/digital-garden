A **Bézier curve** is a curve expressed in the [[./Bernstein basis|Bernstein basis]]:
$$
\gamma(s) := \sum_{k = 0}^{n} B_{n, k}(s) p_k
$$

Those points $p_k$ are called *control points*.

For n = 1, we just get a line segment. But for n = 3, we get "**cubic Bézier**":

There are some nice features about the cubic Bézier curve:
1. endpoints are interpolated
2. The curves are tangent to end segments
3. The curves are contained in [[convex hull|convex hull]] (nice for rasterization)

The 3D version of a Bézier curve is a [[bézier patch|bézier patch]].
## Piecewise Bézier
Since high-degree Bernstein polynomials don't interpolate well, we usually piece together many low-order Bézier curves. To get _seamless_ curves, we need _points_ and _tangents_ to line up:
