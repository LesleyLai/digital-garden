# Hedonic Treadmill
The concept of the **hedonic treadmill**, also known as hedonic adaptation, refers to the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative changes in their life circumstances.

The hedonic treadmill can act as a double-edged sword: it can shield against the blows of traumatic events, yet simultaneously impede the  happiness gains in the long run. [^1]
