---
## Confounding
- unaccounted [[./confounding variable|confounding variable]] - treatment and the control group differ in some third variable which influences the response that is being studied
  - e.g. a hospital may select healthier subjects for surgery

## Data Collection Bias
When we conduct a experiment or survey, there are many possible sources of possible bias. For example:
- [[./sampling bias|sampling bias]] - sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others
  - [[consent bias|consent bias]] - participants choose whether or not they take part in the experiment
  - [[selection bias|selection bias]] - a systematic tendency to exclude or include one type of person from the sample
  - [[survivorship bias|survivor bias]] - when only certain types of participants finish the study
  - [[adherence bias|adherer]] - when participants who adhere to a study protocol or intervention differ from those who do not adhere
  - social desirability bias: people may not tell the truth for questions like "do you use drugs"
- [[observer bias|observer bias]] - when the participants or investigators are aware of the identity of the 2 groups, and so we can get bias in either the responses or evaluations
  - [[placebo effect|placebo effect]]

## Bias of an Estimator
The [[bias of an estimator|bias of an estimator]] is the difference between an estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated.

## Interpretation
- [[./correlation does not imply causation|correlation implies causation]]
- [[./ecological correlation|ecological fallacy]] - the interpretation of statistical data that occurs when inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inferences about the group to which those individuals belong
- [[reporting bias|reporting bias]] - selective revealing or suppression of information

## Cognitive Biases
- [[Gambler's fallacy|Gambler's fallacy]]
- [[./base rate fallacy|base rate bias]]
  - also called *prosecutor's Fallacy*, can be viewed as confusion of the  probability $P(A | B)$ with the probability $P(B | A)$
