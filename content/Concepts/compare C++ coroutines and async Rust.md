Both [[./C++ Coroutines|C++ Coroutines]] and [[./async Rust|async Rust]] uses [[stackless coroutines|stackless coroutines]], but they have some differences:

C++ coroutines always dynamically allocate, where Rust's coroutine state are allocated on stack by default. See [[./why C++ coroutines allocate on the heap|why C++ coroutines allocate on the heap]]
