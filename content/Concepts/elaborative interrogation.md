**Elaborate interrogation** is a study strategy involving asking "how" and "why" questions and finding those answers.

The process of elaborate integration
-   annotate the source materials with questions,
-   requires an explanatory response from myself
-   do this process iteratively, initially with the help of source and do it verbally, until I don't need the source and then I can write the note down

Questions should be phrased to evoke meaningful response. Phrasing questions with "how" and "why" are particularly useful.
