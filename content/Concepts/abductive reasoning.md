**Abduction reasoning** draw conclusion based on the explanation that best explains the current state of events rather than from evidence provided by the [[premise|premises]].

Sherlock Holmes
"When you have [[process of elimination|eliminated the impossible]], whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"

e.g.
- Anna told you she failed her physics midterm.
- Anna hasn't been in physics class since your teacher graded the exams.
- Anna has been in sociology class, which meets right after physics.
Conclusion: Anna dropped physics

Another
- You and your roommate ate sushi last night.
- You both wake up with violent stomach aches.
Conclusion: You and your roommate ate some bad sushi

Abduction also can't provide certainty.
