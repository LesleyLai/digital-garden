# Euler's Number
There are multiple ways to define $e$, one was is to [[./limit definition of e|use limits]]
![[./limit definition of e#^b18ef4|limit definition of e > ^b18ef4]]

- [[./Euler's formula|Euler's formula]]
- [[e (Euler's Number) is seriously everywhere|e (Euler's Number) is seriously everywhere]]
