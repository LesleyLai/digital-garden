## REM Sleep
**Rapid eye movement sleep (REM)** Dreaming usually occurs during REM
Muscles paralysed
Time in REM sleep increases through the night
(25% of total sleep time)

## NREM Stages
- stage 1: Transition between wake and sleep. Easy to wake from, may not be aware asleep (5% of total sleep time)
- stage 2: Light sleep (45%)
- stage 3 - previously devided into stage 3 and 4: also known as *slow-wave sleep (SWS)*, deep sleep, harder to wake from. Results in "sleep inertia" if woken from this stage (25%)
