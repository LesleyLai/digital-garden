In vector calculus, the $\nabla$ operation is call "[[Del operator|Del]]" and can be written as `\nabla` symbol in Latex. It is a vector operator whose components are the corresponding [[partial derivative|partial derivative]] operators:
 $$
   \nabla f=\left[\begin{array}{c}
   \partial / \partial x_{1} \\
   \vdots \\
   \partial / \partial x_{n}
   \end{array}\right]
$$
> [!note]
> The Del operator is not really a vector as its components like $\partial / \partial x_{1}$ are operators rather than numbers

It is seen in [[./gradient|gradient]], [[./divergence|divergence]], and [[./curl|curl]].
