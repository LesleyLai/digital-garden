# Metabolic Equivalents (METs)

Exercise experts measure activity in **metabolic equivalents**, or **METs**. MET is the ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate. One MET is defined as *1 kcal/kg/hour* and is roughly equivalent to the energy cost of sitting quietly. 

A MET also is defined as oxygen uptake in ml/kg/min with one MET equal to the oxygen cost of sitting quietly, equivalent to 3.5 ml/kg/min.
