**Cornell notes** is a note taking strategy that splits a note vertically into "questions/cues" and "notes". It also adds a summary section at the end.

It can be an effective tool in class, while reading books, or reading articles online.

Proponents claim that this note taking method keeps brain active in several different ways. We can both write down what we learn and think analytically.

The summary can be challenging, but **don't skip them**. It forces you to digest the material and transform into your own language. Try to do it as soon as possible after learning and information is still fresh.

> To use Cornell notes in this vault, adds a `cssclasses: cornell-note` property to the note and add `<div class="cues-header">Cues</div>`. Then use `<aside>` tag as cue and `<summary>` tag as summary.
