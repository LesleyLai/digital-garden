# Learning by Teaching
A technique developed by [[Richard Feynman|Richard Feynman]] involves the following steps:
1. Explain a topic in plain, jargon-free language (as if to 5 years old)
2. identify gap in the explanation.
    - The points where we struggle to explain are where we need to revisit
3. Go back and reread, until we can organize and simplify the explanation
