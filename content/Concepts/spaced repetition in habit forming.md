# Spaced Repetition in Habit Forming
For a behavioral change to become lasting, it must be integrated into our sense of self. Utilizing **spaced repetition** is the key method to accomplish this.

Rather than attempting drastic habit changes all at once, it's more important and effective to engage in a chosen behavior for short periods over numerous occasions.

This principle can applied to various habits such as [[reduce sitting time|reduce sitting time]], [[nutrition|eat health diet]], or exercise.
