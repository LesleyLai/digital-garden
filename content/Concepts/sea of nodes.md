**Sea of nodes** is a graph representation of [[./static-single assignment|static-single assignment]] of a program that combines [[./data flow analysis|data flow]] and [[./control flow graph|control flow]], and relaxes the control flow from a [[total order|total order]] to a [[partial order|partial order]], keeping only the orderings required by data flow. [^2]

The [[V8 JavaScript engine|V8 JavaScript engine]] was once notable for being one of the few large-scale compilers utilizing the sea of nodes approach. However, it has since transitioned to a more traditional [[./control flow graph|CFG]] IR, citing reasons such as the sea of nodes being too complex, too limited, and too slow for compilation [^1].

> [!quote] in a way, **SoN is just CFG where pure nodes are floating** [^1]
