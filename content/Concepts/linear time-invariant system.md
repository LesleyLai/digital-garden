A **linear time-invariant (LTI) system** is a system that satisfies both [[./linear system|linearity]] and [[./time invariant system|time-invariance]]. These characteristics apply, at least approximately, to many important systems.

In such cases, the system's response $y(t)$ to any given input $x(t)$ can be found directly using [[./convolution|convolution]]:
$$y(t) = (x * h)(t)$$
where $h(t)$ is the system's [[impulse response|impulse response]]. [^1]

A good example of a LTI system is any [[./electric circuit|electric circuit]] consisting of [[resistor|resistors]], [[capacitor|capacitors]], and [[inductor|inductors]]. [^1]
