# Intermediate Value Theorem
## In Metric Space
Let $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a [[./continuous functions|continuous map]] and $E$ be any [[./connected space|connected]] subset of $X$. Then for all $a, b \in E$, let $y$ to be a real number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, there exists an $c \in E$ such that $f(c) = y$.
