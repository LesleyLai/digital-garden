When we conduct a survey, there are many possible sources of possible [[bias of an estimator|bias]]. For example:
- **[[selection bias|selection bias]]**: A systematic tendency to exclude or include one type of person from the sample.
- **non-response bias**: Caused by participants who fail to complete surveys. That's why [[response rate|response rate]] is always important.
- **interviewer bias**: When the interviewer has to make a choice of participants in the survey, or when characteristics of the interviewer have an effect on the answer given by participants.
  - e.g. when a professor interviews students about their own course
- **measurement bias**: When the form of the question in the survey affects the response to the question.
- **recall bias**: When participant may forget details
- **social desirability bias**: people may not tell the truth for questions like "do you use drugs"
