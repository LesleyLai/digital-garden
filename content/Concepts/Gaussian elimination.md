# Gaussian Elimination
**Gaussian Elimination** is an algorithm to solve systems of [[./system of linear equation|system of linear equation]].

It first reduces a matrix to a [[./triangular matrix|upper-triangular matrix]] and [[back substitution|back substitutes]] the result.

We can augment a matrix with the right hand side of the equation to create an [[augmented matrix|augmented matrix]].

And then we can perform *elementary row operations* on the augmented matrix. Those row operations will not change the solution of the equation:
> [!definition] elementary row operations
> 1. Switch two rows
> 2. Scaling row
> 3. [[./linear combination|Linearly combining]] two rows

We reduces the augmented matrix row-by-row until its left side reaches the [[./triangular matrix|upper-triangular form]].

> - x_1 - 7  x_2 + 2  x_3 &= -27. \\
> \end{array}\end{cases}\end{equation}

Gaussian elimination suffers from the problems of numerical instability and redundant computation, and [[./LU factorization|LU factorization]] is often a preferred numerical algorithm.
