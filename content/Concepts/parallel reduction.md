# Parallel Reduction

An [[reduction|reduction]] operation applies a binary operator to a sequence of element and get back a single result.

To apply parallel reduction, the binary operator must be *associative*.

Note that we can just modify the array in-place.

Parallel reduction is not [[arithmetic intensity|arithmetic intensive]], it takes only 1 add so it is completely memory bandwidth bounded.
