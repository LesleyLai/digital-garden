# Microgeometry
Microgeometry is the minute geometric irregularities found on a surface. It shares similarities with [[./nanogeometry|nanogeometry]], albeit on a larger scaleâ€”larger than the wavelength of light but still smaller than a pixel.

Microgeometry tilt the surface in various directions. We can view it as changing of local normal.

Typically, we model microgeometry as a statistical aggregate, providing the foundation for the [[./microfacet theory|microfacet theory]] employed in physically-based rendering.
