# Rust `Deref` and `DerefMut`

Those two traits are for dereferencing operations like `*v`. They are often used by compiler implicitly (which is called [[Deref coercion|Deref coercion]]).

The Rust documentation recommends to **only implement those traits for [[./Rust smart pointers|smart pointers]]** to minimize confusing. Other uses, such as using [[./Deref polymorphism anti-pattern|using Deref to mimic polymorphism]], are considered anti-patterns.

Those traits should also never fail.

Example:
```rust
use std::ops::Deref;

struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        &self.0
    }
}
```

Rust compiler will then transform `*y` into `*(y.deref())`.
