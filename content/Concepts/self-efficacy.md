**Self-efficacy** is a personal belief in their capacity to act in the ways necessary to reach specific goals. The concept was originally proposed by the psychologist [[Albert Bandura|Albert Bandura]] as part of his [[social learning theory|social learning theory]]. [^1] [^2] 

It is hypothesized to affect an individual's choice of activities, effort expanding, persistence in the face of obstacles, and play a crucial role in human functioning, influencing motivation, behavior, and emotional reactions. [^3]

Note that self-efficacy is not a general confidence in one’s competence. Instead, one's level of self-efficacy can vary from task to task. For example, an individual may have high self-efficacy in mathematics but low self-efficacy in programming.

Various factors influence self-efficacy, and Bandura placed them into four categories [^2]
- **previous performance**
- **vicarious experiences**: Watching or hearing about someone else who has successfully accomplished a task in the past makes you more likely to believe that you can do it too.
- **messages from others**
- **physiological state**: e.g., stresses and anxiety
