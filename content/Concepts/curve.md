# Curve
Curves in a plane can be specified in two different ways: implicitly or parametrically.

The implicit representation specifies the solutions to an equation yields a curve in the plane. Such as $y = x^2 - 3$ or $x^2 + y^2 = 4$

The parametric representation specifies coordinates as function of a parameter.
Such as
$$
   \begin{aligned}
     x(t) &= t \\
     y(t) &= t^2 - 3
   \end{aligned}
$$
 or
$$
   \begin{aligned}
     x(t) &= 2 \cos(t) \\
     y(t) &= 2 \sin(t)
   \end{aligned}
$$
