# Ball

Let $(X, d)$ be a [[./metric space|metric space]], let $x_0$ be a point in $X$, and let $r > 0$. We defined the **ball** $B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r)$ in $X$ to be the set
$$
B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r) := \{ x \in X : d(x, x_0) < r \}
$$

When it is clear what the metric space is, we can abbreviate the notation as $B(x_0, r)$.

As long as $r$ is positive, a ball always contains at least one point, the center $x_0$.
