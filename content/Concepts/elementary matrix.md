# Elementary Matrix

An **elementary matrix** is a matrix that can be transform into an [[identity matrix|identity matrix]] with a single [[elementary row operation|elementary row operation]]. In other word, doing one step of elementary row operation in [[./Gaussian elimination|Gaussian elimination]] is the same as multiplying an elementary matrix.

> [!example]+
> The following elementary matrix $M$
> $$
> \left(\begin{array}{llll}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
2 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)
> $$
> multiplies the first row by 2 and adds it to the second row when doing matrix multiplication like $MA$
