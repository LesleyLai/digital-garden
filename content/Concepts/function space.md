# Function Space
A very important usage of [[./vector space|vector spaces]] are [[functions|functions]] as vectors, the function space arise as the study of [[./differential equations|differential equations]].

For example, for real functions, we can certainly add/scale functions
 - $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$
 - $(af)(x) = a(f(x))$
And we can prove that the properties for vector space all hold.
