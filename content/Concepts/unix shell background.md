# Unix Shell Background
## Launch a Process to Background
adds an ` & ` after the command

> [!note] The program will still write to stdout
> We can use `command > /dev/null 2>&1 & ` to suppress that (redirect stdout to `/dev/null` and stderr to stdout)

## To Foreground the Process
We can use `fg`. To see a list of jobs, we can use `jobs`

## To Background a Currently Running Process
Press `Ctrl + Z` to put the current process on sleep and return to shell, then use `bg` to resume the job in background.
