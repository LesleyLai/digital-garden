Python 3.8 Walrus operator makes assignment an [[expression|expression]]. For example,

```python
print(is_new := True)
```

It can be useful during while loop or if statement:
```python
words = ['falcon', 'sky', 'ab', 'water', 'a', 'forest']

for word in words:
    if ((n := len(word)) < 3):
        print(f'warning, the word {word} has {n} characters')
```
