**Aliasing** is the high frequencies in original [[./signal|signal]] masquerade as low frequencies after [[./sample reconstruction|reconstruction]]. (due to undersampling)

> Images can also be decomposed into "frequencies." And thus is also subject to aliasing.

When can be more precise about when aliasing occurs by the [[./Nyquist-Shannon theorem|Nyquist-Shannon theorem]].
