A problem commonly debated on the Internet to a degree that r/maths has a [pinned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/maths/comments/18n3nsa/0999_is_equal_to_1/) for it.

To prove that, we can treat $0.999\dots$ as a [[./geometric series|geometric series]]:
$$
\begin{align}
0.999\dots 
&= 0.9 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{10} + \left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^3 + \cdots \right) \\
&= 0.9 \left( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{10}} \right) \\
&= 0.9 \ \frac{10}{9} \\
&= 1
\end{align}
$$
