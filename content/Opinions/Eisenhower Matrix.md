# Eisenhower Matrix
![[../eisenhower.png|500]]

Some advocate tackling important and urgent tasks as a priority, while others advocate prioritizing important yet not urgent tasks daily to cultivate [[../Concepts/long-term focus|long-term focus]] and steer clear of the urgency trap.[^1] For example, the idea of task management systems like [[GTD|GTD]] and [[../Concepts/PARA framework|PARA]] all based on "weight urgency by importance."

I think the Eisenhower matrix poverlooked an individual's willingness to do a task. For example, I tend to prioritize tasks categorized as "important but not urgent," like learning or personal projects, while procrastinating on  "important and urgent" tasks such as tedious paperwork. My tendency to [[../Concepts/procrastination|procrastinate]] is more influenced by my dislike for a task rather than its level of importance or urgency.

Additionally, I believe that "delegate" carries a sense of privilege. For those not in leadership roles, there's often no one to handle their "not important" tasks. Moreover, attempting to shift mundane tasks onto peers is unethical.
