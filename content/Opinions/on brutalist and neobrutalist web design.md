# On Neobrutalist Web Design
I can't stand those "neobrutalist" web designs, particularly the ones with dreadful color schemes, bizarre typography, and so on. They make the website unnecessarily hard to read only to satisfy the designers' taste, which I don't share.

At least for articles, I can use the browser's reader mode, even though it might mean sacrificing features like syntax highlighting. I could only suffer for other types of pages, though it is likely I will just quit if I don't need to use that site.
