**Psychology Today** is a non-peer-reviewed pop-psychology platform, where the quality of articles can vary significantly. While some offer valuable educational content supported by credible references, others promote blatant pseudoscience. Moreover, a notable portion of the platform's content consists of numerous pro-Christian posts.

I still find some articles from this site valuable, but take everything read there with extra skepticism. It's useful to check the author's credentials and other works.

## Sources of Higher Quality On Average
- Peer-reviewed scientific journals
- Wikipedia
- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org)
