This note is sparked by discussion of [this supposed "diversity training"](https://twitter.com/eyeslasho/status/1776968355540299927?t=adrieWYvtdK6D2H8K4kVNg).

I think using contrived examples to test human morality is meaningless. There are basically no [[external validity|external validity]] of what is being discussed and what an actual problem is, and such discussion are often served as [[red herring|red herring]]. It is also concerning how easy it is to get [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinism]] conclusion from those discussion and then use them to justify real-world behavior.

Now I do think sacrificial dilemmas is *entertaining* to watch in shows and anime, but they should not be used in day-to-day discussion or as justification of anything.

There are psychologists who [share the same kind of concern](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5j0215cr) too.
