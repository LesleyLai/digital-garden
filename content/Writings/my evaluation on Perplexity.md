[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) is "a free AI-powered answer engine that provides accurate, trusted, and real-time answers to any question."

I find that it often delivers higher-quality responses on academic topics compared to ChatGPT. Additionally, it has the advantage of citing sources. A workflow I particularly enjoy is using it to "check the accuracy" of notes I've just written.

However, Perplexity can still hallucinate a lot, and at times, it quote source materials in ways that differ significantly from the original content. Therefore, applying your own judgement and verifying the sources is still crucial.
