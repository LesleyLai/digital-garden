Hi there! I’m Lesley Lai, and this is my little corner of the web where I share my notes that I accumulated since 2023, mostly focused on math and programming. I also post a few informal articles sharing my personal opinions here.

Most of the notes and articles here are incomplete and unpolished, reflecting my limited understanding. I usually don’t proofread them, and if you come across any errors, feel free to leave a comment on that page.

I keep a [[./Concepts/Quartz customization log|customization log]] for this site.

## What You Will Find Here?
- [[./Concepts/math|Mathematics]]: ranging from different branches such as [[./Concepts/logic|logic]], [[./Concepts/calculus|calculus]], [[./Concepts/linear algebra|linear algebra]], and [[./Concepts/probability MOC|probability]]
- [[./Concepts/computer|Programming]]: topic ranging from programming languages like [[./Concepts/C++|C++]] and [[./Concepts/Rust|Rust]], and fields such as [[./Concepts/computer graphics MOC|computer graphics]] and [[./Concepts/programming languages MOC|programming languages]]
- Notes in various other areas that capture my interest
- Personal opinions and rants

Not sure where to start? Check the [[./Concepts/note index|note index]] or [[./Opinions/my opinions|my opinions]].
